Here are a few projects I'm working on in my free time:
<br/>

* [Listening To](/listeningto.html) - A .NET Web API app (using my
[Lastfm.NET](http://github.com/asciamanna/LastfmClient) library) with an
AngularJS / Bootstrap front end.  It displays the last 25 songs I've listened
to and my top 25 artists.

* [Lastfm.NET](http://www.github.com/asciamanna/LastfmClient) - A .NET client for
the Last.fm REST API.

* [Music Collection](http://musiccollection.apphb.com) - A .NET MVC4 / Bootstrap app to manage my music collection.
