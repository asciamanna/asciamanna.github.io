Disqus is an online service provider of Disqus, Inc, 301 Howard St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, https://disqus.com/ (“Disqus“), which provides a centralized discussion platform for websites. In our online services, we have integrated Disqus plugins that allow website visitors to post comments on our websites and link comments across multiple sites (including third party websites).

If you enter a page on our website which includes a Disqus plug-in, your browser will establish a direct connection to the Disqus servers from where the plug-in is loaded. The information that your browser visited the corresponding page of our online services is transmitted to Disqus, even if you do not have a Disqus account or are not logged into your account. This information is sent directly from your browser to a Disqus server in the USA and stored there.

If you log into your Disqus account at the same time, it is also possible to assign the page retrieval to your Disqus account and allow Disqus to assign your surfing behavior directly to your account.

If you want to block the transmission and storage of your data and your behavior, you must log out of your Disqus account before you visit our website and delete any cookies placed by Disqus.

To post a comment on our website (using a Disqus plug-in), you must log into your Disqus account. When you post a comment on the website, Disqus collects information about your visit to our website and other websites, including the information you post and your IP address.

Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access.
