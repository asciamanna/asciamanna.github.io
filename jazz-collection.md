title: Jazz Collection
---

As a drummer who previously attended [Berklee College of Music](http://www.berklee.edu)
before pursuing a career in software development I am an avid music collector.
I'm a fan of a lot of music. Primarily jazz and fusion but I also love new wave / post punk,
metal, and progressive rock. Below you can find my jazz music collection:
