Code katas provide an opportunity to practice our software development skills, recognize patterns, and learn how to apply practices. In general, we professional software engineers don't spend enough time practicing. The Gilded Rose Kata is one of my favorites. 

Following along as I refactor the Gilded Rose code to eliminate the code smells identified at the beginning of the screencast. One goal was to keep the screencast to an hour or less. I deferred a few design decisions and refactorings at the end, but made the largest improvements so that adding the new Conjured Inventory Item was a simple two-minute code change. The Gilded Rose is a great example of Kent Beck's advice:
