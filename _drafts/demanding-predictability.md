One of the main reasons software organizations want to adopt agile ways of working is to become more predictable. Understandably, software is a business; and businesses want to know when products will be delivered, the funding and personnel required to meet organizational goals, etc. The problem with how I see this realized in the industry is that the vast majority of these companies have not made the cultural shifts to fundamentally change the way they work. Trying to demand predictability from teams creating software, which is uncertain and unpredictable by its nature, is a recipe for disaster. Often I tell organizations if they adopt agile ways of working and truly change the way they operate they will become more predictable, but likely this is not "predictability" as they currently understand it.

It sounds like a riddle, but adopting practices that embrace the unpredictable and uncertain nature of knowledge work will make organizations able to better predict. 

According to [the 14th Annual State of Agile Report](https://stateofagile.com/#ufh-i-615706098-14th-annual-state-of-agile-report/7027494), 39% of respondents adopted agile to become more predictable. Without understanding how they need to shed their old ways of planning and predicting they will be undermining their own efforts to improve the way they deliver value to their customers.

## Agile is Adaptive Not Predictive

You may have heard of this saying before, **Agile is adaptive not predictive**. What does this mean? Waterfall is predictive, which is why it usually a bad choice for software development. In waterfall scope is fixed upfront; software organizations attempt to predict when they can deliver a specific set of features before they start the work. Those predictions become deadlines,traditional project management focuses on the iron triangle: managing a project to deliver all defined scope on time and on budget. In an attempt to make an unpredictable practice more predictable by working the creators harder results quality issues (quality is often abandoned first when trying to meet unrealistic deadlines), missed dates, unhappy customers, and overworked and burnt out developers. 

Now agile ways of working at its heart embraces the unpredictable and uncertain nature of software development. So to harness these benefits organizations need to get away from trying to fix scope and schedule up front or to work their teams harder when "agile" didn't give them the fixed scope and date guarantee they were looking for (it won't ever give you that). 

Agile is adaptive in nature, in fact Scrum (still the most popular agile framework) is built on empiricism. This allows organizations to make decisions based on experience. By introducing regular intervals to inspect, adapt, get feedback through various feedback loops and adapt their plan they can become more predictable. 

> Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Shed the Old Ways
In command-and-control, waterfall organizations that still rely on traditional project management methods plans are made upfront. Any deviation from the plan is considered a problem. The team didn't estimate properly, the estimate is treated as a deadline, something needs to be fixed and if the development team was wrong they'll just have to work harder to get back on track. Or well-intentioned management will put more people on the project (which usually results in further delays achieving the opposite of the intended goal). 

Software development, like other forms of knowledge work, is unpredictable. A detailed plan for more than a few weeks is wasteful work and a work of fiction. Stop using detailed plans as a measure of success. Anything that predictable likely should be automated away so your best developers can focus on creating software not continuous guesses about when they will be done knowing the negative consequences if they have guessed wrong. 

## The Cost of Demanding Predictability
When demanding predictability for work that is inherently unpredictable, like software development the organization incurs signifcant costs. 

### Quality Degrades
Quality degrades as teams struggle to meet upfront plans (further jeapordizing future releases)
### Increase in Waste Activities
Developers spend more time estimating work and trying to "improve estimation." Spending skilled developers' time trying to get better at estimating is a fool's errand. Estimating is a waste activity, and as lean teaches us, trying to find ways to spend less time estimating is critical to increase value delivery to our customers. 
### Absence of Experimentation, Improvements, and Learning
The best software development teams continuously experiment. Its through this experimentation the team continuously improves how they work and innovate. These activities will stop altogether when teams are under pressure. 

### Morale issues
As a developer I have had first hand experience having my estimates used deadlines and then reprimanded when we didn't hit dates. As a technical lead I sat with Product Managers explaining agile estimation, the cone of uncertainty, estimate ranges, and not to commit to features but outcomes. Operating in a low-trust, dysfunctional organization - none of these things worked. Product Managers were perceived to be in a position of power over developers (thinkers versus the workers). So if the developers couldn't deliver what the Product organization told them to they'd just keep hiring more developers and offshoring more work. Not surprisingly, this just slowed the development organization to a crawl and the best developers left to find work elsewhere. 

By forcing the very people doing the uncertain work to commit to estimates (which are purely forecasts) you will undoubtedly be creating a terrible morale problem. And to be blunt this is simply inhumane regardless of whatever spin the company tries to put on it. 

## Getting to Agile Predictability 

### Always Releasable / Always Releasing
No unknowns - 

### Continuous Quality

### Roadmap Outcomes Not Specific Features

#### Focus on Sprint Goals 

#### Push Authority to the Information

### Continous Customer Interaction 

### Ruthlessly Prioritize

Quote L David Marquet quote

## Continuously Refine the Plan 
Small detail 
## Cone of Uncertainty

## The Myth
There is a myth that you can be agile and have deadlines. This couldn't be further from the truth. We operate in a world where software is ubiquitous. This means we often have to meet regulatory dates or incur fines, deliver a feature before a competitor, or demonstrate a new capability at an important conference. By focusing on the aforementioned practices and not fixing specific scope for a deadline, there is no better way to hit a date than by using agile practices.
