Recently I was fortunate to hear [Alistair Cockburn](http://www.alistaircockburn.us)'s keynote at the [Heart of Agile 20017](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/) in Pittsburgh. During his talk he discussed Shu-Ha-Ri and the path to mastery. It started me thinking about how many organizations I've seen stifle this mastery before it ever begins to take hold. 

## What is Shu-Ha-Ri?

> Shuhari is a Japanese martial art concept, and describes the stages of learning to mastery. It is sometimes applied to other disciplines...  
> &mdash; [Wikipedia (May 20, 2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari)

You can read more about Shu-Ha-Ri on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari). It has been discussed in the context of agile software development for several years thanks to [Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri) and others including [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html).

### Applied to Agile

This is how I describe Shu-Ha-Ri as applied to a Scrum team.

#### Shu

Teams start out in Shu by following the Scrum Guide and agile consultants' advice like recipes or formulas. They don't understand the value of what they are doing yet but they are optimistically following along the best they can. 

#### Ha

When the team gets to the Ha state they are performing Scrum well. They now understand and have internalized the value in the practices. Furthermore, they understand how the practices support the larger agile principles and values. They have progressed beyond just following the Scrum Guide and beginner advice. Having branched out they start learning about other methods like XP, Kanban, lean software development techniques, etc. They are recognizing that Scrum doesn't always hold every answer for them and are beginning to apply other techniques outside of their initial teaching to their daily work.

#### Ri

When teams get to the Ri state they have fully internalized the agile values and have mastered the art of improvisation. They don't follow a strict methodology but adopt practices and methods that best meet their needs given the context of the problem and their team. They grow even further by creating their own practices or hybrid practices that best meet their needs.

### The Dreyfus Model 
A modern analogue to Shu-Ha-Ri is the [Dreyfus Model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) from the 1970s. It consists of five stages:
1. Novice
1. Advanced Beginner
1. Competent
1. Proficient
1. Expert

You can learn more about the Dreyfus Model in [Andy Hunt](http://www.toolshed.com/)'s excellent book, [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning).

## A Problem with Agile Adoptions

### Resetting Teams

I've encountered agile transformation consultants who encourage every team in a development organization to have identical practices. I don't necessarily fault them for this advice, they are trying to accomplish a lot in a very short period of time. Further, the experience level of teams within the organization can vary significantly. The unfortunate result of this however forces every team to follow these strict formulas. I've heard one consultant say, _"I know that some of you have been agile practitioners for a decade, but everyone here has to go back to Shu and follow these steps exactly."_ That comment illustrated that the consultant didn't understand what effect that would have on the productivity and morale of the organization. 

#### The Cost of Ri Teams Operating at Shu

One important aspect of the Dreyfus model research is that they have found that having experts follow the same rules that they devised for novices resulted in the experts performing at the novice level. While it was shown that these rules did help novices improve.<sup>[1](#research)</sup>

### Scrum "By-the-Books"
I often hear organizations say _"We do Scrum by the books!"_ They position this as a positive trait of the organization, that they are so advanced in their Scrum implementation that they **follow these recipes exactly**. I cringe when I hear this, because I've seen this translate to teams with morale problems stuck in the Shu state.

I don't have anything against Scrum, I find it a very valuable agile framework. Reading the [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) you will realize it is prescriptive but lightweight framework. However, the "by-the-books" implementations I've seen added a lot of agile consultant practices on top of the Scrum Guide that teams are expected follow to the letter by their organizations. 

#### Skipping to Ri

I understand that these organizations are sending a message that they didn't skip right to the Ri state. Doing Scrum "by-the-books" means that they haven't invented their own practices that completely disregard agile principles and values. Unfortunately, this too is very common given how desirable it has become to call an organization "agile".

However, these "by-the-books" organizations that have thankfully not skipped the Shu and Ha states are only one step ahead, being permanently stuck in the Shu state.

### Scrum Masters

Great Scrum Masters can really help teams improve, however having worked on successful XP teams I have not been convinced they are always necessary. I've seen well-meaning but poorly prepared Scrum Masters exacerbate this "By-the-Books" problem because they too are beginners and still just following formulas. 

To become a Certified Scrum Master you need to pay for and attend a two day course, pass a test that is nearly impossible to fail, and get your certification. While I know that the creators of Scrum considered this the beginning of your Scrum journey, too often it is the only formal training Scrum Masters ever receive. 

Now we have people whose experience is limited to two days of classroom sessions with the word "Master" in their job title. Unwittingly organizations rely on these people as experts and yet they have no more relevant experience than anyone else in the organization.

### Codifying Beginner Formulas

Organizations typically begin their "agile transformation" by getting Scrum training. Consultants come in for several weeks and teach the organization these beginner formulas. Their goal is to get everyone to the Shu state and on the same page. Unfortunately, it is common for companies just starting their agile journey to believe that keeping every team working the exact same way is an organizational optimization (I've written about this at length about this topic [here](/2017/03/05/remove-cross-team-dependencies.html)).

The belief is that it's easier for leadership to buy-in to this new way of working and manage at the portfolio-level when every team works the same way. But no one asks what the company is losing in return. The sacrifice is substantial: team performance, morale, and the ability for teams to improve themselves through retrospectives. They are sacrificing the same agile principles and values that they are trying to adopt. 

This results in companies codifying these beginner formulas before the team has a chance to master them. The codifying of these beginner rules ensures that teams cannot deviate from them. This halts all progress towards mastery as teams are permanently stuck in the Shu state.

## Drive
The book _[Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500119191&sr=8-1&keywords=drive)_ by [Daniel Pink](https://twitter.com/DanielPink) describes three components to intrinsic motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Preventing teams from getting to the Ha and Ri states destroys both autonomy and mastery on teams. It should come as no surprise that there are so many failed agile adoptions that leave a trail of frustrated people in its wake. 

## A Better Approach

Following agile consultants' formulas exactly is a Shu state activity. You should absolutely not skip this step to avoid teams that never understand the agile principles. However, don't codify these practices, even if the Scrum Guide says it's how teams should work. Let teams progress and master these practices, internalize the values, and then modify these practices to be unrecognizable to the ones in the Shu state. Otherwise, you are optimizing the organization for mediocrity and people will leave to achieve mastery elsewhere.
