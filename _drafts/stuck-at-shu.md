Recently I was fortunate to hear [Alistair Cockburn](http://www.alistaircockburn.us)'s keynote at the [Heart of Agile - Pittsburgh](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/). His talk was about Shu Ha Ri

The Problem with Agile Adoptions

- Downsides of "Scrum by the books" 
- Agile coaches come in and tell teams --- doesn't matter where you are at you all need to start at "Shu." Shu is following recipes.  DMM - if experts are asked to follow beginner steps they will perform like beginners. 

Companies bring in agile coaches - ask everyone to follow recipes - These recipes are for "shu teams." These recipes get codified by the company never allowing teams to advance to "Ha" or "Ri" stages. I have seen the morale problems come from this. Development teams get frustrated as the company "completes their agile transformation" leaving the teams in a very mediocre state. Often teams feel like they will never be able to get over these codified rules since they would need to convince organizational leadership to change the rules

## Scrum Masters
Being a great scrum master can be a huge benefit to teams. But I've seen poorly prepared scrum masters exacerbate this problem because they too are beginners are are following recipes. To become a scrum master you need to attend a two day course, pass a test that is nearly impossible to fail, and get your certification. While I know that the creators of scrum considered this the beginning of your Scrum journey, too often it is the only exposure Scrum Masters have. Now we have people with two days of experience with Scrum (and no practical experience), with "Master" in their title. Unknowing organizations rely on these people as experts and yet they have no more relevant experience than anyone else in the organization. Or worse yet, actually much less experience than others in the organization who could never be Scrum Masters because they don't have their two-day certificate. 

## Warning
Remember following Scrum by the books is your team's Shu state. Do not codify these practices, let teams progress and master these practices, internalize the values, and then modify these practices to be unrecognizable to the ones in the "Shu" state. Otherwise, you are optimizing the company for medocrity and will find turnover as team members leave to achieve mastery elsewhere.
