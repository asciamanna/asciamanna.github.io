Recently I was fortunate to hear [Alistair Cockburn](http://www.alistaircockburn.us)'s keynote at the [Heart of Agile - Pittsburgh](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/). During his talk he discussed Shu-Ha-Ri and the path to mastery. It got me thinking about how many organizations I've seen stifle this mastery before it ever begins to take hold. 

## What is Shu-Ha-Ri?

> Shuhari is a Japanese martial art concept, and describes the stages of learning to mastery. It is sometimes applied to other disciplines...

You can read more about Shu-Ha-Ri on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari). It has been discussed in the context of agile software development for several years thanks to [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html), [Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us), and others.

### Applied to Agile

This is how I describe Shu-Ha-Ri as applied to a Scrum team.

#### Shu

Teams start out in Shu by following the Scrum Guide and agile consultants' advice like a recipes or formulas. They don't understand the value of what they are doing yet but they are optimistically following along the best they can. 

#### Ha

When the team gets to the Ha state they are performing Scrum well and starting to understand and internalize the value in the practices and agile principles and values in general. They have progressed beyond just following the Scrum Guide and beginner advice and now have an understanding of XP, Kanban, lean software development techniques, etc. They are recognizing that Scrum doesn't always hold every answer for them and are beginning to apply other techniques to their daily work.

#### Ri

When teams get to the Ri state they have fully internalized the agile values and have mastered the art of improvisation. They don't follow a strict methodology but adopt practices and methods that best meet their needs given the context of the problem and their team. They grow even further by creating their own practices or hybrid practices that best meet their needs.

## The Problem with Agile Adoptions

### Resetting Teams

One issue I see with agile adoptions is that some agile consultants encourage every team in a development organization to work the same way. I don't necessarily fault them for this advice, they are trying to accomplish a lot in a very short period of time. The unfortunate result of this however is forcing every team to follow these strict formulas. I've heard one consultant say, _"I know that some of you have been practicing agile for a decade, but everyone here has to go back to Shu."_ That comment illustrates that the consultant didn't understand what effect that would have on the productivity and morale of the organization. 

#### Dreyfus Model
One important aspect of the Dreyfus model research is that in experiments they have found that asking experts to follow the same rules as beginners resulted in the experts performing at the beginner level. 

### Scrum "By-the-Books"
I often hear organizations say _"We do Scrum by the books!"_ They position this as a positive trait of the organization, that they are so advanced in their Scrum implementation that they **follow these recipes exactly**. I cringe when I hear this, because what I've seen in practice is that this translates to teams with morale problems stuck in the Shu state.

#### Skipping Shu

I understand that these organizations are trying to send a message that they didn't skip the Shu state altogether. Doing Scrum "by-the-books" means that they haven't invented their own practices that completely disregard agile principles and values. Unfortunately, this is something that is very common given how desirable it has become to call an organization "agile".

However, these "by-the-books" organizations that have thankfully not skipped the Shu state are only one step removed, being permanently stuck in the Shu state.

### Scrum Masters

Great scrum masters can really help teams improve, however having worked on very successful XP teams I'm not convinced that they are always necessary. I've seen well-meaning but poorly prepared scrum masters exacerbate this "By-the-Books" problem because they too are beginners and still just following formulas. 

To become a scrum master you need to pay for and attend a two day course, pass a test that is nearly impossible to fail, and get your certification. While I know that the creators of Scrum considered this the beginning of your Scrum journey, too often it is the only formal training Scrum Masters ever receive. 

Now we have people whose experience is limited to two days of classroom sessions with the word "Master" in their job title. Unwittingly organizations rely on these people as experts and yet they have no more relevant experience than anyone else in the organization. Or worse yet, they actually have much less experience than others in the organization who could never be Scrum Masters because they haven't paid for their two-day certificate. 

### Codifying Beginner Formulas

Organizations typically begin their "agile transformation" by getting Scrum training. Consultants come in for a few weeks to a few months and teach the organization these beginner formulas. Their goal is to get everyone to the Shu state and on the same page. Unfortunately, a significant number of companies without agile experience believe that every team working the exact same way is somehow an organizational optimization (I've written about this at length here (POST)).

The belief is that it's easier for leadership to buy-in to this new way of working and manage at the portfolio-level when everyone works the same way. But no one asks what the company is giving up in return. What's given up is substantial: team performance, morale, and the ability for teams to improve themselves. They are sacrificing the same agile principles and values that they are trying to adopt. 

This results in companies codifying these beginner formulas before the team has a chance to master them. The codifying of the rules ensures that teams cannot deviate from them, because deviation would mean teams were doing things differently. This halts all progress of mastery as teams are permanently stuck in the shu state forever.

## Drive
The book drive talks about the three things that motivate people: autonomy, mastery and purpose. Preventing teams from getting to the Ha and Ri states destroys both autonomy and mastery on teams. It should come as no surprise that there are so many failed agile adoptions that leave a trail of frustrated people in its wake. 

## A Better Approach

Following the Scrum Guide and agile consultants' formulas exactly is a Shu state activity. You should absolutely not skip this step to avoid teams that don't understand the values at all. However, don't codify these practices, even if the Scrum Guide says it's how teams should work. Let teams progress and master these practices, internalize the values, and then modify these practices to be unrecognizable to the ones in the Shu state. Otherwise, you are optimizing the organization for mediocrity and people will leave to achieve mastery elsewhere.
