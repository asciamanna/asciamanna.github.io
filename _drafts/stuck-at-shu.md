Recently I was fortunate to hear [Alistair Cockburn](http://www.alistaircockburn.us)'s keynote at the [Heart of Agile - Pittsburgh](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/). During his talk he discussed Shu-Ha-Ri and the path to mastery. It got me thinking about how many organizations I've seen stifle this mastery before it ever begins to take hold. 

## What is Shu-Ha-Ri?

> Shuhari is a Japanese martial art concept, and describes the stages of learning to mastery. It is sometimes applied to other disciplines...
> &mdash [Wikipedia (May 20, 2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari)

You can read more about Shu-Ha-Ri on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari). I have long heard it discussed in the context of agile software development thanks to talks and articles by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html) and Alistair Cockburn. 

### Applied to Agile
This is how I describe Shu-Ha-Ri as applied to agile teams.
#### Shu
Teams start out in Shu by following the "Scrum Recipes." They don't really understand the value of what they are doing but they are following along. 

#### Ha
When they get to the Ha state they are mastering the practices and starting to understand and really internalize the agile values. They understand more than just "Scrum recipes" but now understand XP, Kanban, lean software development techniques, etc. Now they are starting to understand that all of the "Scrum Recipes" don't always apply to their organization and are beginning to apply other techniques to their daily work.

#### Ri
When teams get to the Ri state they have fully internalized the agile values and have mastered the art of improvisation. They don't follow a strict methodology but adopt practices and methods that best meet their needs given the context of the problem. They grow even further by creating their own new practices that best meet their needs. 

### The Dreyfus Model 

## The Problem with Agile Adoptions

### Resetting Teams
One huge issue I see with agile adoptions is that agile coaches come into organizations and try to get the entire organization working the same way. This unfortunately results in forcing every team to follow these strict recipes. I have personally heard coaches state, _"I know that some of you have been practicing agile for ten years, but everyone here has to go back to Shu."_ That comment just proved to me that these coaches didn't really understand what that means to the productivity of the organization. 

#### Dreyfus Model
One important aspect of the Dreyfus model research is that in experiments they have found that asking experts to follow the same rules as beginners resulted in the experts performing at the beginner level. 

### Scrum "By-the-Books"
I often hear organizations say _"We do Scrum by the books!"_ They position this as a positive, that they are so advanced in their Scrum implementation that they **follow the recipes exactly**. I cringe when I hear this, because what I've seen in practice is that this translates to a bunch of teams stuck in the Shu state.

### Scrum Masters
Great scrum masters can really help teams improve, however having worked on very successful XP teams (without scrum masters) I'm not convinced that they are required. I've seen well-meaning but poorly prepared scrum masters exacerbate this "Scrum By-the-Books" problem because they too are beginners and still just following recipes. 

To become a scrum master you need to attend a two day course, pass a test that is nearly impossible to fail, and get your certification. While I know that the creators of Scrum considered this the beginning of your Scrum journey, too often it is the only formal training Scrum Masters ever receive. Now we have people with two days of classroom experience with Scrum (and no practical experience), with "Master" in their job title. Unknowing organizations rely on these people as experts and yet they have no more relevant experience than anyone else in the organization. Or worse yet, they actually have much less experience than others in the organization who could never be Scrum Masters because they don't have their two-day certificate. 

### Codifying Beginner Recipes

Organizations typically begin their "agile transformation" by getting Scrum training. Consultants come in for a few weeks to a few months and teach the organization these beginner recipes. Their goal is to get everyone to the shu state and on the same page. Unfortunately, a significant number of companies without agile experience believe that every team working the exact same way is somehow an organizational optimization (I've written about this at length here (POST)).

This is not their fault as I've seen agile consultants recommend this too. They believe its easier for leadership to buy-in or manage at the portfolio-level when everyone works the same way. But no one asks what the company is giving up in return. What they are giving up is team performance, morale, and the ability for teams to improve themselves, and the very agile values that they are trying to adopt. 

This results in companies codifying these beginner "Scrum recipes" ensuring that teams cannot deviate from them, because deviation would mean teams were doing things differently. This halts all progress of mastery as teams are permanently stuck in the "shu state" forever (or at least until they leave the company).

### Drive
The book drive talks about the three things that motivate people: autonomy, mastery and purpose. When forcing teams into the Shu state this eliminates both autonomy and mastery. So it should come as no surprise that there are so many failed agile adoptions that leave a trail of frustrated developers and testers in its wake.

## Warning
Remember following Scrum by the books is your team's Shu state. Do not codify these practices, let teams progress and master these practices, internalize the values, and then modify these practices to be unrecognizable to the ones in the "Shu" state. Otherwise, you are optimizing the company for mediocrity and will find turnover as team members leave to achieve mastery elsewhere.
