Too often companies have tunnel vision, focused on decreasing the costs associated with developing software. As a result they often end up spending more money for worse results. Worse still, poor delivery and development associated with this style of "lowest bidder" software development creates ample opportunity for the company to be eclipsed by their competitors. A myriad of factors come into play to create this development culture, but it often starts with treating software development as a cost center. 

The history of software development is one where software existed as a back office activity to automate and improve processes, etc. It is reasonable to see why, at that time, it was considered a cost center. Fast-forward to today where software is a critical part of most companies (tightly integrated with the business). Even more directly software is often the primary product that companies produce (SaaS for example). For most companies the accounting hasn't been so quick to adjust, while they still try to minimize the costs of software development. While it may seem obvious to seasoned agile practitioners, it is often hard to convince companies that minimizing the costs of the activity that creates your revenue stream is a bad idea. That would mean throwing out accounting metrics by which senior leadership is judged. 

## Cost Center Culture

This cost center mentality has a serious impact on culture of software development in these companies. It is this culture together with the cost minimizing focus that drives a lot of decisions that further sink the value of the software being created.  

### Decision Makers vs. Workers
I discuss the divide between decision makers and workers in software development a lot. This is one of those cultural issues that is hard to break and stands in the way of real organizational change necessary to successfully adopt agile software development values. Software companies that continue to treat software development as a cost center often do it because they create a division between the decision makers and the workers. 

The decision makers are the real brains of the product the company produces. The developers are just the order takers implementing the ideas of their product organization (or sales organization, or marketing organization, etc.). This in turn creates an organization that is organized to slowly deliver issue-laden software that doesn't meet the customers' needs. 

The best software engineers want to solve business problems not to be handed solutions to implement. Similarly, the most successful software companies move authority to the point of information, so that the teams creating the software are involved in the discovery process, identifying the problems to solve, and solving the problems for their customers.

#### Outsourcing and Offshoring
Now, if there is a division between the decision makers and the workers the company is free to sell the software development to the lowest bidder. Even the most critical parts of development can be outsourced and offshored, because the company believes that software development is a commodity. 

Now, for non-software companies this can often be a fine idea. But for those companies where software is critically linked to their business or the product they create, this is big problem. 

#### Lean & Agile Lessons
This style of work introduces huge delays in work and creates the culture where teams are only focused on output not business outcomes. The lessons we've learned from Lean Software Development and Agile over the last two decades is that the best software (i.e., the best customer experiences and the software that delivers the most value to customers) is created by teams having ownership of the business outcomes, not output.

### Organizational Hierarchy
In cost center cultures teams are expected to deliver output and this creates an opportunity for an increase in organizational hierarchy. If software teams aren't responsible for making decisions and there is a focus to reduce their cost, the focus on investment is on the leadership and the organization responsible for making the product decisions. This is where we see organizational hierarchy grow; Development Managers, Development Directors, Development Vice Presidents, Product Managers, Project Managers, Program Managers, etc.  

As these hierarchies grow feedback loops break or become significantly lengthened so that they provide no value to the teams delivering software. The decision makers are so far removed from the decisions they make, they don't see the affect it has on software teams' abilities to deliver and the issues it creates in the software being delivered.

### Obsession with Operating at Scale
When software is viewed as a commodity, the attributes of successful and productive software teams is obscured. Organizations wrongly think they can deliver more value faster by hiring a lot of low-cost developers instead of paying more for a small number of developers and creating conditions where they thrive. The belief is that each developers is just a pair of hands to take orders and turn them into code. This is something that Industrial Logic Senior Consultant Tim Ottinger calls _the Context-Free Fungible Developer_, and it is a myth. 

As companies grow, add more developers, and do it in such a way that doesn't minimize dependencies between teams even more leadership and process is necessary to manage and orchestrate these dependencies. As a result, more leadership and hierarchy is introduced outside of the development teams.

### Lack of Autonomy

### Lack of Discipline

## A Path Forward


that the cost of development should be minimized, an obsession with working "at scale", and a lack of autonomy and discipline at the team level. We'll unpack each of these in this post.

Some companies do not sell a software product nor software services. If they can find an off-the-shelf software solution to meet their needs or hire a consultancy to deliver it to them, they do that. However, as software continues to take on more critical roles in the success of non-software companies, it is common for these companies to build custom software and not realize its importance to their success. These companies have yet to find out that they are indeed software companies. While they may not sell a software product or service, the software has become so critical to their business they need to focus on how well it is developed.

Even more troubling than this scenario are the software companies that fall into the same category. Software product and/or services companies with an apparent lack of vision that seemingly haven't figured out that their technology organization should be treated like a profit center rather than a cost center.

What does this mean?

For starters these companies try to minimize the cost of software development. Often they focus on offshoring development, outsourcing their software development to the lowest bidder. This in turn creates a department that is organized to slowly deliver issue-laden software that doesn't meet the customers' needs. Moving development offshore but "product decisions" in house creates an organization that separates the people doing the work from the decision makers.

This can be found in companies that don't offshore development but treat their in house teams as order takers. if all teams are treated as mercenaries, doing as their are instructed to the codebase, the quality will decline.

The best software engineers want to solve business problems not to be handed solutions to implement. Similarly, the most successful software companies move authority to the point of information, so that the teams creating the software are involved in the discovery process, identifying the problems to solve, and solving the problems for their customers.

As more hierarchy is introduced and feedback loops are either broken or significantly long. Often these companies think they just need more developers and more teams. So they bring more folks in, making communication more difficult and adding more dependencies that need to be managed. Now the vicious cycle begins because these activities further slow the teams down.

If instead a focus on small, independent, teams that operate from discovery to delivery (from concept to cash) exist these organizations will realize much better results. If instead of throwing money at a large number of "cheap developers" they instead focus on spending money on a smaller number of great teams they will thrive. Hire senior developers who are coaches and mentors, not lone wolves who want to work alone. Invest in bringing in new developers and interns to create a culture of continous coaching and onboarding. Encourage a culture of continuous experimentation and learning and don't allow that to be optional but in the DNA of the company. Focus on development leaders that want to empower autonomous teams but also stress the importance of discipline and quality-first practices, don't let those be optional either. Give ownership and autonomy but coach teams on discplined, quality-focused practices. Don't let a replacement for a quality practice be a preference for hacking, churning, and heroics.
