It is still the norm for software companies to have cost accounting tunnel vision, too focused on decreasing the costs associated with developing software. As a result they end up spending more money for worse results. Worse still, poor delivery and development associated with this style of "lowest bidder" software development creates ample opportunity for these companies to be eclipsed by their competitors. A myriad of factors come into play to create this kind of development culture, but it often starts with treating software development as a cost center.

The history of software development is one where software existed primarily as back office activities to automate and improve processes, etc. It is reasonable to see why, at that time, it was considered a cost center. Fast-forward to today where software is a critical part of most companies, being tightly integrated with the business (take the modern autombile that has more lines of code than the Windows operating system 1(QUOTE BOOK). Even more directly software is often the primary product that companies produce (SaaS for example). For most companies the accounting hasn't been as quick to adjust, while they still try to minimize the costs of software development. It may seem obvious to seasoned agile and lean practitioners, it is often hard to convince companies that focusing on minimizing the costs of the activity that creates their revenue is a bad idea. That would mean throwing out accounting metrics by which senior leadership is often judged.

## Cost Center Culture

This cost center mentality has a serious impact on the culture of software development in these companies. The decisions that get made in the interest of managing costs further complicate the organization, making it even harder to deliver value to customers quickly.

### Decision Makers vs. Workers
I discuss the divide between decision makers and workers in software development regularly. This is one of those cultural issues that is hard to break and stands in the way of the real organizational change necessary to successfully adopt agile software development values. Software companies that continue to treat software development as a cost center often do it because they create a division between the decision makers and the workers. This is typically realized as a separation between IT and the business. They interact as separate functional silos in the company. 

In these organizations, the decision makers are the real brains of the product the company produces. The IT organization is just the order takers implementing the ideas of "the business." This chasm between the technology and the business is often a cause of the bottlenceks in the value stream. Contrast this with the most successful software companies who move authority to the point of information, so that the teams creating the software are involved in the discovery process, identifying the business problems to solve, and solving the problems for their customers.


#### Outsourcing and Offshoring
If there is a functional divide between the decision makers and the workers, then the company is free to sell the software development to the lowest bidder. Even the most critical parts of development can be outsourced and offshored, because the company believes that the creation of the software, and the software developers who create it, are a commodity.

### Common Enterprise Trap
Take a look at how some of the most successful tech companies work, and compare that to the typical enteriprise software company. The differences are glaring. These enterprises toil away adopting agile scaling methodologies and failing, while they cling to Taylorism, organizational hierarchy, and centralized power and planning structures. They are operating with a management playbook that worked 100 years ago and trying to apply that to creative knowledge work. They manage to cost reductions, project deadlines, and output not business outcomes.

### Organizational Hierarchy
In cost center cultures teams are expected to deliver output and this creates a need for increased organizational hierarchy. If development teams aren't responsible for making decisions, and there is a focus to reduce their cost, the focus on investment is on the leadership and the organization responsible for making the product decisions. This is where we see organizational hierarchy grow. Combine this interest in hierachy with functional silos and we have a recipe for a massive leadership organization; Development Managers, Development Directors, VPs of Development, Product Managers, Project Managers, Program Managers, QA Managers, QA Directors, Operations Managers, UX managers, and on and on. 

Attempting to create cross-functional teams is an exercise in frustration, where each team has just as many direct managers as members of the team. And each of those managers are part of a hierarchy that has its own stake in what each team works on. These teams often end up getting competing direction creating pressure in the team. They are asked to work together to deliver but also are required to adhere to each individual manager's goals - which can often be at odds with the team's goals. 

### Broken Feedback Loops
As these hierarchies grow feedback loops, if they exist at all, become significantly lengthened so that they provide no value to the teams delivering software. The decision makers are so far removed from the decisions they make, they don't see the affect their decisions have on the software teams' abilities to deliver and the issues those decisions create in the software being delivered.

### Obsession with Operating at Scale
When software development is viewed as a commodity, the attributes of successful and productive software teams are obscured. Organizations wrongly think they can deliver more value faster by hiring a lot of low-cost developers instead of paying more for a small number of developers and creating conditions where they can thrive. The belief is that each developers is just a pair of hands to take orders and turn them into code. This is something that Industrial Logic Senior Consultant Tim Ottinger calls _the Context-Free Fungible Developer_, and it is a myth. 

Unfortunately, adding more developers to a system of work like the one I'm describing often has the opposite of the intended effect. As the number of developers increase communication becomes more difficult, and the dependencies between teams increase the complexity of the work. As a result, more hierarchy in leadership is introduced making it take increasingly longer to deliver any software. Decisions that could be made by a single development team (in a successful agile organization) now takes weeks as leadership has meetings to set process and policy. As the number of developers increase and the dependencies between them increase a massive coordination effort is required to deliver any value to customers. 

### Lack of Autonomy & Discipline
One of the lessons we've learned from Netflix's success is that if you give teams a vision, a problem to solve, autonomy _AND_ the teams are disciplined you have created an environment for great things to happen. Minimizing costs of software development is often incompatible with disciplined development practices. In these organizations that focus on output, agile technical practices like TDD, pair & mob programming, microtesting, refacotring, and CI/CD are often ignored. Not only because these practices take time to master but because they are viewed as "slowing output." Internal quality is often invisible in these companies and ignored in favor of delivering more output. That is until the house of cards falls. 


## A Path Forward
If instead there is a focus on small, independent, development teams that operate from discovery to delivery (from concept to cash) these organizations will realize much better results. It's time to retire cost accounting metrics in favor of value delivery metrics and metrics around business outcomes. Understanding the organizations value stream and where the bottleneck is in the process is critical.
