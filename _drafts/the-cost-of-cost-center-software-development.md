It is still the norm for software companies to have cost accounting tunnel vision, too focused on decreasing the costs associated with developing software. As a result they end up spending more money for worse results. Worse still, poor delivery and development associated with this style of "lowest bidder" software development creates ample opportunity for these companies to be eclipsed by their competitors. A myriad of factors come into play to create this kind of development culture, but it often starts with treating software development as a cost center.

The history of software development is one where software existed primarily as back office activities to automate and improve processes, etc. It is reasonable to see why, at that time, it was considered a cost center. Fast-forward to today where software is a critical part of most companies (tightly integrated with the business). Even more directly software is often the primary product that companies produce (SaaS for example). For most companies the accounting hasn't been so quick to adjust, while they still try to minimize the costs of software development. It may seem obvious to seasoned agile and lean practitioners, it is often hard to convince companies that minimizing the costs of the activity that creates their revenue is a bad idea. That would mean throwing out accounting metrics by which senior leadership is often judged. 

## Cost Center Culture

This cost center mentality has a serious impact on the culture of software development in these companies. The decisions that get made in the interest of managing costs further complicate the organization, making it even harder to deliver value to customers quickly.

### Decision Makers vs. Workers
I discuss the divide between decision makers and workers in software development regularly. This is one of those cultural issues that is hard to break and stands in the way of the real organizational change necessary to successfully adopt agile software development values. Software companies that continue to treat software development as a cost center often do it because they create a division between the decision makers and the workers. 

In these organization, the decision makers are the real brains of the product the company produces. The developers are just the order takers implementing the ideas of their product organization. It is still common to functionally separate the product organization from the technology organization. This in turn creates a technology department that is organized to slowly deliver issue-ridden software that doesn't meet their customers' needs. 

The best software engineers want to solve business problems not to be handed solutions to implement. Similarly, the most successful software companies move authority to the point of information, so that the teams creating the software are involved in the discovery process, identifying the problems to solve, and solving the problems for their customers.

#### Outsourcing and Offshoring
If there is a functional divide between the decision makers and the workers, then the company is free to sell the software development to the lowest bidder. Even the most critical parts of development can be outsourced and offshored, because the company believes that the creation of the software, and the software developers, are a commodity. 

#### Lean & Agile Lessons
This way of working introduces significant delays in the value stream creates a culture where teams are only focused on output not business outcomes. The lessons we've learned from Lean & Agile Software Development over the last two decades is that the best software (i.e., the best customer experiences and the software that delivers the most value to customers) is created by teams having ownership of the business outcomes, not output.  

In fact, taking a look at the most successful tech giants versus companies that toil away trying and failing with agile scaling methodologies, it becomes obvious that the truly successful tech companies have cracked the riddle, and understand how to organize their company in this age of software, giving up the Taylorist management practices and organizational hierarchy that seemed to work during the Industrial Resolution. 

QUOTE FROM ACCELERATE
this one maybe - The fact that software delivery performance matters provides a strong argument against outsourcing the development of software that is strategic to your business, and instead bringing this capability into the core of your organization.

### Organizational Hierarchy
In cost center cultures teams are expected to deliver output and this creates a need for increased organizational hierarchy. If software teams aren't responsible for making decisions, and there is a focus to reduce their cost, the focus on investment is on the leadership and the organization responsible for making the product decisions. This is where we see organizational hierarchy grow; Development Managers, Development Directors, VPs of Development, Product Managers, Project Managers, Program Managers, QA Managers, QA Directors, Operations Managers, UX managers, and on and on. 

Attempting to create cross-functional teams is an exercise in frustration, where each team has just as many direct managers as members of the team. And each of those managers are part of a hierarchy that has its own stake in what each team works on. These teams often end up getting competing direction creating pressure in the team. They are asked to work together to deliver but also are required to adhere to each individual manager's goals - which are at odds with the team. The manager's work often wins - they are responsible for their employees performance reviews after all.

### Broken Feedback Loops
As these hierarchies grow feedback loops, if they exist at all, become significantly lengthened so that they provide no value to the teams delivering software. The decision makers are so far removed from the decisions they make, they don't see the affect their decisions have on the software teams' abilities to deliver and the issues those decisions create in the software being delivered.

### Obsession with Operating at Scale
When software development is viewed as a commodity, the attributes of successful and productive software teams are obscured. Organizations wrongly think they can deliver more value faster by hiring a lot of low-cost developers instead of paying more for a small number of developers and creating conditions where they can thrive. The belief is that each developers is just a pair of hands to take orders and turn them into code. This is something that Industrial Logic Senior Consultant Tim Ottinger calls _the Context-Free Fungible Developer_, and it is a myth. 

The thought is that the company can simply deliver more value faster by adding more developers. Unfortunately, as they add more developers the opposite happens. As the number of developers increase communication becomes more difficult, and the dependencies between teams increase the complexity of the work.As a result, more hierarchy in leadership is introduced making it take increasingly longer to deliver any software. Decisions that could be made by the development team (in successful agile teams) now takes weeks as leadership has meetings to set process and policy. As the number of developers increase and the dependencies between them increase a massive coordination effort is required to deliver any value to customers.

### Lack of Autonomy & Discipline
One of the lessons we've learned from Netflix's success is that if you give teams a vision, a problem to solve, autonomy _AND_ the teams are disciplined you will surprised by the results. Minimizing costs of software development is often incompatible with disciplined development practices. In these organizations that focus on output, agile technical practices like TDD, pair & mob programming, microtesting, refacotring, and CI/CD are often ignored. Not only because these practices take time to master but because they are viewed as "slowing output." Internal quality is often invisible in these companies and ignored in favor of delivering more output. That is until the house of cards falls. 


## A Path Forward
If instead a focus on small, independent, teams that operate from discovery to delivery (from concept to cash) exist these organizations will realize much better results. If instead of throwing money at a large number of "cheap developers" they instead focus on spending money on a smaller number of great teams they will thrive. Hire senior developers who are coaches and mentors, not lone wolves who want to work alone. Invest in bringing in new developers and interns to create a culture of continous coaching and onboarding. Encourage a culture of continuous experimentation and learning and don't allow that to be optional but in the DNA of the company. Focus on development leaders that want to empower autonomous teams but also stress the importance of discipline and quality-first practices, don't let those be optional either. Give ownership and autonomy but coach teams on discplined, quality-focused practices. Don't let a replacement for a quality practice be a preference for hacking, churning, and heroics.
