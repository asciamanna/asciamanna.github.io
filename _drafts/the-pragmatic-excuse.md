* My time on an XP team with other teams surrounded by teams with different values
	* Often claimed they were "pragmatic" unlike our team.
	
* Being pragmatic as an excuse to not adopt team values or practices.  Or to abandon them in stressful situations in order to "get things done." 

* Great teams have a shared set of values, practices that support those values. They also have regular retrospectives so that if a practice emerges that better supports the team's values they will adopt it. Something I've noticed is that teams without values use the term "pragmatic" to rationalize the lack of practices. Claiming that teams who stick to their values and practices in times of stress or when pressured from other parts of the organization to "push harder," "do more with less," etc.
During times of stress teams need to rely on their practices not abandon them
