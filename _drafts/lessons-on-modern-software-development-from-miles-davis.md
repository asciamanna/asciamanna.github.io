- My history
- Similarities of jazz (improvisational music) and agile
- Missing ingredient in poor agile implementations (scrum and safe)
    - Modern Agile - experiment and learn rapidly
    - Without those ingredients you will get no innovation
- Herbie's first story in his book
    - there are no mistakes 
    - "The Poison is the cure"
    SO much fear in software organizations --- focusing on estimating and being predictable that they play it too safe. They adopt scaling frameworks like SAFe so they can continue the Tayloristic old ways of software development (ways we know don't produce the best outcomes) and can call it 'agile'
