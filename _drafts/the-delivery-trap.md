Erik Dietrich - delivery trap
Another delivery trap can be found in feature factory development organizations. If you are unfamiliar with the term it was coined by John Cutler in his article 12 signs you are working in a feature factory. Another sign that you are working in a feature factory is if individuals fall into the delivery trap.

The delivery trap is the result of a feature factory organization that only focuses on team output, robbing teams of autonomy, mastery, and purpose giving them prescriptive solutions to solve and treating them like "digital ditch diggers"

Once someone is on a scrum team in these organizations (and I'll say scrum because I'm sure this is most common on teams practicing scrum or SAFe) all they can do is maintain the status quo because they are on an endless treadmill of getting their work done by the end of the sprint and meeting their velocity estimate.

Too often velocity is treated not as a short-term planning tool for the team but a productivity measure. The goal is to see a continued increase in velocity and decrease in velocity is a cause for alarm to be discussed by leadership. As a result teams push to constantly increase their velocity. Teams treat sprints like clown cars, jamming as many story points into them as possible. An increasing velocity must prove that they are working hard and generating output.

There is no chance for people on these teams to experiment, learn, or improve anything about their work. It would decrease their velocity output metric and put their deadlines at risk.

These teams are now hamstrung, and cannot move the needle in the organization. No substantive change to a process, practice, piece of code, software design, user experience, etc. can come from these teams. They have no opportunity to experiment or learn. Because, if you're being judged by velocity taking time to learn things and experiment and fail doesn't look so good.

These teams have fallen into the delivery trap. And one way to identify if your comapny suffers from this is if most of the people who are trying to make substantive change had to escape the delivery team to do so.

Need an improvement to the build pipeline? Give it to an individual who isn't on a team. Need to identify third-party libraries for automating the testing of an API? That work has to go to someone who isn't building APIs - someone outside of a delivery team. The architecture and overall design of the system hasn't improved? We must need a separate architecture organization that employs traditional architects who operate outside of cross-functional delivery teams to make these improvements and push them down on to the teams.

All of these efforts mask the problem and continue the cycle of the delivery trap. The teams are stuck on their treadmills until they've had enough and leave to find employment elsewhere. I've seen too many great software developers leave companies, feeling undervalued by the organization since they were treated as minions in a "masters and minions" organization. The message from leadership, "We determine the work, we parcel out the work, you'll get your small piece of the project and implement it exactly how it's specified." It should come as no surprise that this way of working optimizes for mediocrity and your best engineers will leave to find their autonomy, mastery, and purpose elsewhere. This exact situation is described in an article by Tim Ottinger called, http://agileotter.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-scatter-gather-method-of-software.html

Breaking Free
To break this cycle the company needs to shift its focus from "sales driven" or "feature driven" to things like Lean Software Development, DevOps and Modern Agile. Looking at the four principles of modern agile - if your company takes them seriously or the Three Ways of DevOps or the theories found in Lean Software Development there will be push to make autonomous teams who make decisions about the work and improve the work - since they are the ones who are most qualified to do so.
