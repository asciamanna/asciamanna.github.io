Lean Coffee is a fantastic meeting facilitation technique. I've used it to host company meetings, user group meetings, knowledge sharing sessions, and even as a retrospective technique. It is simple to learn, has a lot of benefits over traditional meeting facilitation techniques, and is a lot of fun. At a time when more and more technology and software companies are going remote, there are plenty of tools available to facilitate a virtual lean coffee.

When I was coaching development teams with [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com), we started each day of the Dojo with a Lean Coffee session. It was a great idea to share knowledge across teams going through the Dojo experience separately, but also a way to include organizational leadership in conversations about what we were doing with the teams.
