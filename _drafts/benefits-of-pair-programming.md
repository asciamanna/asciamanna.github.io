In my previous post <LINK> I discussed the misconceptions about pair programming. When trying to encourage resistant development organizations to learn pair programming its not only important to understand the misconceptions but also be able to articulate its benefits. Pair programming addresses so many common issues in development organizations I consider it an essential practice of modern software development teams. 

## A Social Activity

Software development is a social activity. The greatest software teams are expert collaborators. Time and time again I've seen teams who pair program constantly collaborate incredibly well. Pair programming creates daily opportunities to practice this collaboration. So if I were to pick the most important aspect of pair programming is that encourages, and gives teams continuous practice, with collaborative software design and development.
