In my previous post <LINK> I discussed the misconceptions about pair programming. When trying to encourage skeptical development organizations to learn pair programming its not only important to understand the misconceptions but also be able to articulate its benefits. Pair programming addresses so many traditional sofwtare project issues in development organizations I consider it an essential practice of modern software development teams. 

## A Social Activity

Software development is a social activity. The greatest software teams are expert collaborators. Time and time again I've seen teams who pair program consistently, collaborate incredibly well. Pair programming creates daily opportunities to practice this collaboration. So if I were to pick the most important aspect of pair programming is that encourages, and gives teams continuous practice with, collaborative software design and development. 

## Mentoring

While I see benefits to formal mentorship programs and the relationship between a manager and her direct reports, neither of these are a replacement for the mentoring that happens on teams who pair program. Mentoring happens every day in the code, providing realtime feedback on decisions. The feedback cycle in these pairing sessions is incredibly short, providing many opportunities per day for mentoring. 

It is no coincidence that I achieved my greatest growth during my time on an XP team and greatly improved my coaching skills as well. On teams who pair program, everyone becomes a coach and mentor.

## Knowledge Acquisition

Pair programming accelerates knowledge acquisition on teams which provides many benefits to teams. Onboarding new developers happens fast. Instead of working in isolation and getting feedback after going too far in the wrong direction they are getting immediate feedback on their work. 

Learning curves begin to flatten on these teams as members level each other up on the various skills and technologies needed to address their customer's problems. Knowledge travels throught the team incredibly quickly. Teams who switch pairs at least once per day (or sometimes even more) realize these benefits even faster.

### Promiscuous Pairing

If the idea of pair programming is foreign than I am certain the idea of switching pairs once or more per day seems counter-intuitive as well. [Here is a great article on the concept and benefits of Promiscuous Pairing](http://csis.pace.edu/~grossman/dcs/XR4-PromiscuousPairing.pdf) and the benefit to embracing Beginner's Mind. 

## Builds Trust

Teams with high trust are incredibly effective. Trust on teams is essential and is a foundation that high performing teams are built on. Teams that trust each other eliminate so many issues that traditional software development managers have to deal with. 

 This constant and close collaboration on teams that pair program, creates an environment where trust thrives. Developers get to really know and care about their teammates. The XP teams I've worked on ate together regularly, another act that builds trust on teams. This is because they all truly cared for one another as people _and_ colleagues. The handful of folks I worked with everyday on an XP team have continued to be my closest professional colleagues and great friends, years after no longer working together. 

## Collective Code Ownership

One of the twelve XP practices is colletive code ownership. Pair programming helps create collective code ownership on teams. You avoid all of the problems that come from individual developers taking ownership of an area of the code and work on it in isolation.

Code developed by lone developers continues to be the lowest quality code I tend to encounter. These developers have spent months (and sometimes years) learning the idiosyncracies of poor code and after a while don't see the mess that is in front of them. At times their own lack of knowledge of software design affects their decisions, so they just push changes through to hit the dates they need to hit. 

### Eliminates towers of knowledge

Pair programming eliminates towers of knowledge in companies. Towers of knowledge are a risk that no software company should be willing to take. In an industry where (for better or worse) developers get promotions and grow by switching jobs the reality is you cannot keep a developer forever.  A lot of companies allow this to happen and throw money at these developers to keep them. But at some point the developer will get another offer, win the lottery, or just get tired of the specific workplace dysfunction they are dealing with and move on. 

On teams who pair program senior level developers can leave the team without a large impact on the team. When a team member leaves or a new one begins the dynamic on the team always changes. Teams need to rebuild trust and it does take some time. But this is much preferred to taking ownership of huge amounts of a subsystem no one has ever seen because it has been on developer's "baby" for a decade. 

### Single coding standard

A single team coding standard is another XP practice and pair programming also encourages this. To suport eliminating towers of knowledge having code without an individual developers fingerprint on it is helpful. It's much harder to be protective of code and argue against changing code you created when you don't recall who the original author was. Often when I worked on an XP team just week or so after a change I would have no idea who made it.

## Results in higher code quality

The ideas of the team are
Takes the ideas of the team to solve problems. Utilizes the entire team's skills to solve problems. 

### Big problems 
 can't move a king sized mattress by yourself
 Beyond Legacy code

## Limits WIP

### Non-blocking code reviews
No context switching for code reviews.

## Interruption Blocker

People are less likely to interrupt two people working together

## Avoids Distractions

Pairs stay in flow longer
