This post is a follow up to my article, The Dangers of Development Tools (LINK). That article described the problems that typically arise 
when teams adopt workflow tools. Tools like JIRA and VersionOne for example.
One topic I didn't address is that when teams choose to move away from a physical card wall to a workflow tool they typically begin to track
lots of meaningless and potentially harmful metrics. This happens for a number of reasons:
* Tracking tool provided metrics come for free
* These tools make tracking custom metrics easy
* These tools recommend tracking these types of metrics

Collecting metrics may seem like the right thing to do for your organization but I argue more times than not managing agile teams by metrics
will devalue your practices and instead push you in a direction that opposes snd violates the agile principles and values. I'm certainly
not saying all metrics are bad. But metrics should be collected for very specific purposes, beyond that they are at best a distraction and at
worst harming your organization.

## What Problem Are We Solving?
The first question to ask yourself when collecting a metric is what problem are you trying to solve or what specific question are you
trying to answer. If you can answer those questions then by all means collect the metric. If you can't answer that or just want the
data to "analyze later" I would strongly recommend avoiding the metric altogether. 

## Metrics as Retrospective Goals
While I do believe people should be skeptical of metrics there is one type I see value in. If a cross-functional team has a problem
that comes out of a retrospective, using a metric to measure the problem and whether any retrospective goals are improving the problem is a very
good idea. What makes these metrics different are two very important characteristics. They are created by the cross-functional team (not being
pushed down from above) and they are temporary. Once the goal has been accomplished the team can stop tracking the metric. 

## Metrics Pushed Down or Cross team Metrics
In contrast, a vast majority of metrics being pushed down to cross-functional development teams by the organizational leadership are problematic.
Again, in some cases these are well-intentioned attempts to measure things across teams (which, by the way, is a bad idea in itself). However,
these types of metrics put your organization at risk to unravel your agile practices and oppose agile principles. 

### Lacking Team Input
don't worry what we're goign to do with them just collect it.
team knows best what they need to do to improve

### A Symptom of Command & Control 

### Gaming Metrics

### Agile Values at Stake
They are typically used as a way 
Metrics coming from above is the first step towards unraveling agile. Originate usually with the adoption of a workflow tool. Coming from above they are usually used to tell teams to do more of one thing and less of the other. Teams game this. Transparency is lost and so is the team ownership of their work.
