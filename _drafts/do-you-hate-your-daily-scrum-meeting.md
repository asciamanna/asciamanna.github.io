One of the things I really dislike about Scrum is the daily the Scrum Meeting, also called the standup meeting. To be fair I did these meetings on an XP team I was on as well, but we weren't stuck with the typical format.

## Three Questions
My biggest issue with the daily scrum is the three questions. They quickly turn into required, time wasting meetings that don't add any value. Everyone stands in a circle, often without the board of work in sight because they use a tool like Jira, and answers three questions. What did I do yesterday? What am I going to do today? Do I need help? One of my first epiphanies I had on an XP team was if the team is aligned and actually works together, this meeting is redundant. When teams operate as teams and collaborate on the work instead of staying in their functional silos this meeting is really just a waste of time. 

To improve this meeting I offer two pieces of advice. 

## Focus on the Work not the People
First I would recommend that you focus on the work instead of the people. Try using a physical card wall for your team. If you have to use a tool like Jira, have it displayed on a large monitor in the team's work area. Now, instead of the daily scrum switch to the "Walk the Board" style kanban meeting. Start at the right-most piece of work (this is the work closest to being done) and determine what it will take to get it done as soon as possible. Do that with every other card started on the board, then wrap up the meeting.

no need for these kinds of meetings
