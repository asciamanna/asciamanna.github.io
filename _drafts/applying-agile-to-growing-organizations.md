Agile teams are supposed to be vertical, cross-functional teams. The team is
supposed to be made up of all of the skills required to deliver a feature from
inception to use in production without external dependencies. This means developers,
product experts, Quality Assurance engineers, database experts, UX experts
(contrary to some current scrum training that says this should be outside
of the team), etc.

## The Horizontal Team Mistake

This makes a lot of sense, but unfortunately I still see a lot of teams build
horizontal teams that deliver technical solutions to each other instead of
delivering user-facing features to production. These organizations have
UI teams, back-end service teams, web services teams, API teams, infrastructure
teams, database teams (who are the only ones allowed to change the database) and operations teams (the only
ones in the organization allowed to deploy to production). A lot of these
organizations are trying to "be agile" and don't understand why they aren't getting
the improvements they were promised.

They don't get faster (and in a lot of cases actually slow down) because their organizational
structure is creating too much friction between feature inception and delivery. They design
into the process an incredible amount of handoffs.

### Increase in Meetings

These handoffs between teams require more coordination and meetings. A symptom of an organization
like this is a dramatic increase in the number of meetings that are required to coordinate the work.

### Increase in Bugs and Missed Requirements

Every handoff is like the telephone game we played as children. The intent and value of the work gets
convoluted with each handoff. So often this ends in delivering features with bugs or missing the value.
One of the brilliant parts of XP was having customer representation or a very realistic proxy of the customer
embedded with the team to ensure that the team is getting continuous feedback about the value of the features
being built.


### Example of Handoffs

## Incorrectly Slicing Agile Teams

There are organizations that understand the concept of a cross-functional, vertical team. However, as
the organization grows they find themselves falling into a trap and building horizontal teams and dependencies
between agile teams.
