title: Creating a Great Development Culture - Continuous Learning & Lack of Crunch Mode

In my previous post I described that great development cultures emphasize code quality and have a shared set of values and development practices. In this post I will describe the other qualities great development teams have, **a culture of continuous learning** and a **lack of crunch mode or overtime**.

##A Culture of Continuous Learning
Several of the practices described in the previous post are concerned with learning. Great teams learn together and make learning a top priority of the organization. No deadline interferes with the team getting better. In addition to retrospectives and code reviews there are several other learning techniques I've found common across development organizations.

###Lunch and Learn
Teams should regularly get together to learn as a group. Whether it be team refactoring sessions, code katas, or watching a video of a talk or presentation. Encouraging teams to constantly get better and bring new information into the organization is critical. It is all too easy to get mired in the day-to-day work and stop improving your craft.

###Bring in Thought Leaders
The development community has plenty of thought leaders and many travel to speak at conferences. Get in touch with those who may be in your area or are visiting your area and bring them in to your office. I've found all of my heroes to be accessible and willing to share their expertise.

###Get Out of Your Codebase
If you are working in a legacy codebase (one that is not unit tested or at least not well unit tested) it is important to get out of it for learning opportunities. Legacy codebases tend to be hard to make better without the required skills and time. Try out new techniques in well-factored codebases or smaller side projects before bringing them into your codebase if there are some refactoring hurdles you need to get past. 

Too often a team will accept the codebase as their reality, put blinders on and maintain that low quality. It helps to see what others are doing. It is a huge motivator to see well crafted code, how easy it is to maintain, to unit test, and to reason about. It gives the team a tangible goal to strive for.

###Read
Start a reading group at work. There are so many great software development books and blogs today. You can seriously level-up your development skills by reading a few fantastic books. A reading group at work is another opportunity to learn and talk about quality and improvement as a team.

###We are not Unique

**The biggest barrier to continuous learning is the thought that development organizations are unique.** This is a very important concept and one I will discuss in much more detail in a future post. However, any development organization that contends that it is unique is mistaken. As a development organization your product should be unique, your domain *may* be unique, but **the way you build software is not unique nor should it be**. As developers we all do the same things and great practices can be applied to development organizations regardless of their domain, organization, team, etc. 

This line of thinking is very dangerous because it puts the development organization on an island and allows them to reason that taking advice from experts is not necessary. It is a breeding ground for "expert beginners." If you are not familiar with the concept of "expert beginners" I highly recommend you read the [series of blog posts](http://www.daedtech.com/tag/expert-beginner) by [Eric Dietrich](http://www.daedtech.com/blog "Eric Dietrich's Blog"), who coined the term.

##Lack of Crunch Mode
Great development organizations avoid crunch mode and overtime. [Chad Fowler](http://chadfowler.com/ "Chad Fowler's website") has a fantastic post about [killing the crunch mode antipattern](http://chadfowler.com/blog/2014/01/22/the-crunch-mode-antipattern/). The fact is, when under pressure developers produce poor quality code. Poor quality code slows your organization down, thus creating more pressure, which in turn creates more poor quality code. It's a cycle that feeds itself and leads to low morale and a terrible codebase.

###Estimates?
If you operate in an environment that requires estimates I would start by ensuring the the development team doing the work is providing the estimates. If a manager, or CEO, or someone else in the organization is coming up with arbitrary dates you are killing team morale and the negative affects on the codebase will be far reaching and cost your organization long term stability and speed. The worst possible environment to build software in is one where the team is racing to meet an unreasonable deadline that management has created while writing terrible code and believing they are doing the right thing as long as they hit the date. In fact, rewarding that ensures that it will continue to happen.

[Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/ "Esther Derby's website") has a fabulous post about the [usefulness of estimating but lack of usesfulness of the actual estimates](http://www.estherderby.com/2012/03/estimating-is-often-helpful-estimates-are-often-not.html). I highly recommend you read it. Remember that estimates are just that, estimates. Too often organizations treat them as the deadlines. Estimates, by their nature are inaccurate. Too many organizations get caught up in a  ridiculous cycle where teams spend time trying to "get better at estimating" instead of getting better at building great software. If you find yourself in this predicament the problem is not the team's ability to estimate but what the organization is doing with those estimates. So, focus some attention there instead.

If there is a legitimate date that needs to be hit be flexible about what functionality is included. Rememeber **_you cannot fix both time and scope_**. While I've had more than one argument with project managers about this in my career it is an absolute truth. Trying to do so is costing your organization. I would argue that a vast majority of deadlines are arbitrary. There is some great work being done in the **No Estimates** community and I recommend you read about it and challenge your organization on how they estimate. Thought workers are not producing their best work when pressured to meet unreasonable deadlines. 

##Conclusion
Bring some of the practices and ideas I've described in these two posts back to your development organization and give them a try. Regardless of your domain, product, level of experience, etc. I guarantee that these suggestions will improve your team and your product.
