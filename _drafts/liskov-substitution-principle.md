One of my primary roles as a development coach is helping software development teams and their organizations build a culture of technical excellence (often helping them build the skills to get to Continuous Delivery). When teams begin their journey to becoming high-performing they need to shed their current habits that are obstacles to their advancement. One of the most common and problematic practices I see is called _Programming by Coincidence_. It is important to be able to spot this practice and help reverse its negative impact on codebases and teams.
