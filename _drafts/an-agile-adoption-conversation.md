__*Our company recently went through an agile adoption.*__

Really? That is fantastic. Working on an XP team was one of the greatest experiences of my professional career.  How do you like it?

__*Uh....Scrum feels like micromanagement. I'd rather get hassled about deadlines once at the end of a project instead of constantly now.*__

Hmmm...that doesn't sound right. Are you releasing after every sprint?

__*No we release quarterly. Sometimes we deploy code more regularly but it doesn't get enabled in production for several months. That's a business decision. We are only responsible for delivering features.*__

Are you getting feedback from customers and users and iterating based on that feedback?

__*Well, no we fix the scope of all of our projects up front. Iterating would mean we would miss the deadlines the organization has set. That would be bad, we'd look like we aren't working hard enough.*__

Do you get any customer feedback?

__*No our scrum team doesn't. We are pretty far removed from the feedback loop. The organization would create a new project based on feedback sometime in the future.*__

Are you getting stakeholder feedback in your sprint review that informs your backlog?

__*No, our management and leadership comes and watches but we don't get any feedback.*__

How is your team estimating? Does your product owner use the estimates to inform future work?

__*No, like I said the work is fixed, the estimates are used to see if we will meet the deadlines. Or at least give the product organization confidence we will meet their deadlines.*__

Is your Scrum Master helping empower your team to improve yourselves?

__*Not exactly, he tells us how the leadership of the organization wants us to work and makes sure we are adhering to those processes.*__

Are you doing retrospectives, then?

__*Yes, we are doing retrospectives. The agile coach did recommend them after all.*__

How does your team adopt retrospective goals if you can't change the way you work?

__*We use the time to vent about problems in the organization and come up with requests for management, since we need their approval to make any changes.*__

So what you are saying is you work on fixed scope projects in two-week timeboxes without iterating or adjustments from stakeholder, customer, or user feedback and you cannot change the way you work based on retrospective outcomes?

__*Yeah, exactly!*__

Then, may I ask, why did your company adopt agile in the first place?

__*They thought we'd give them better estimates and be more likely to meet their deadlines.*__

It sounds to me like your organization has a lot of things to do before adopting agile.
