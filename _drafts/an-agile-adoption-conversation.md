__*The company I work for was interested in agile software devleopment so we adopted Scrum a couple of years ago.*__

Really? That is fantastic. Working on an XP team was one of the greatest, most rewarding experiences of my professional career. How do you like it?

__*Uh....Scrum is just micromanagement. I'd rather get hassled about deadlines once at the end of a project instead of constantly now.*__

Hmmm...that doesn't sound right. Tell me more about it. Are you releasing after every sprint?

__*No we release features quarterly, sometimes it may take us longer than that. We deploy code more regularly but it doesn't get enabled in production for several months. That's a business decision. We are only responsible for implementing the features.*__

That's a long time, are you getting feedback from customers and iterating based on that feedback?

__*Well, no we fix the scope of all of our projects up front. Iterating would put us at risk for missing the deadlines the organization has set. That would be bad, we'd look like we aren't working hard enough.*__

Fixing the scope of your projects? Do you have a Product Owner who is working with your team to craft user stories? 

__*Yeah we have a Product Owner. She's responsible for taking the requirements document and translating it into the user story format to put in our Jira backlog.*__ 

Do you get any customer feedback?

__*No our scrum team doesn't. I've never interacted with a customer. We are pretty far removed from the feedback loop. The organization would create a new project for us based on feedback some time in the future.*__

Are you getting stakeholder feedback in your sprint review that informs your backlog?

__*No, our management and organizational leadership comes and watches to see our progress but we don't get much feedback. They typically ask when we'll be done the project.*__

How is your team estimating? Does your product owner use the estimates to inform future work?

__*No, like I said the work is fixed, the estimates are used to see if we will meet the deadlines. Or at least increase the organization's confidence we will meet their deadlines. We do a lot of high-level estimates for our large projects.*__

How do you do those?

__*We have a brief fifteen to thirty minute conversation with leadership about a project idea and then we guess how long it will take to complete.*__

You don't know any details to make these guesses more meaningful?

__*No, the people asking for the estimates wouldn't know any of the details anyway*__

Does your development team practice any of the XP-based technical practices to help teams deliver with high-quality? Like pair programming, TDD, Continuous Integration, and evolutionary design, for example?

__*No, the agile consultants said it wasn't their place to tell us how to write the code. So we code the same way we used to.*__

Is your Scrum Master helping empower your team to improve yourselves and take ownership of some of these things?

__*Not exactly, he tells us how the leadership of the organization wants us to work and makes sure we are adhering to those processes. It's important to them that all of our teams work the same way.*__

Are you doing retrospectives then?

__*Yes, we are doing retrospectives. The agile consultants did recommend them after all.*__

How does your team adopt retrospective goals if you can't change the way you work?

__*We use the time to vent about problems in the organization and come up with requests for management, since we need their approval to make any changes.*__

So what you are saying is you work on fixed scope projects in two-week timeboxes without iterating or adjustments from stakeholder, customer, or user feedback and you cannot change the way you work based on retrospective outcomes?

__*Yeah, exactly!*__

Then, may I ask, why did your company adopt Scrum in the first place?

__*They thought we'd give them better estimates and deliver projects faster.*__
