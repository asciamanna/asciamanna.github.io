As development organizations adopt agile practices the senior developer and technical lead roles change dramatically. It is very common for organizations to hold on to their previous conceptions of these roles and responsibilities. Trying to transform a development team into an agile team and not changing these roles accordingly will have a negative effect on the team. In doing so these teams will not realize their full potential, becoming less effective and less efficient than they could be.

##Senior Developers
###The Ones Who Get the Most Done
Prior to an organization adopting agile practices development teams typically have individual work assignments. It is easy to see how much work one developer is working on versus another. I'm not saying this is a good metric for comparison mind you. I'm just saying when there are individual work assignments, the person doing the work is visible outside of the development team. Because of this the developers who are perceived as getting the most work done tend to be ones rewarded and the ones who are viewed as the senior developers in the organization.

###Agile Senior Developers - Coaches & Mentors
Once an organization adopts agile development practices getting the most "work" done is __*NOT*__ the most important quality of a senior developer. The senior developers are the ones who are coaching and mentoring the other developers on the team. In addition to "getting work done," they are spending a significant part of their day on coaching and mentoring activities. Listed below are responsibilities I would expect of senior developers on agile teams. The list is a combination of some of my own thoughts and some responsibilities that [Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/ "Esther Derby's website") describes in her post, [But are they Working Hard?](http://www.estherderby.com/2012/02/but-are-they-working-hard.html)

####Responsibilities
* pair programming with other developers
* coaching the team on the technologies used
* coaching the team on domain concepts
* coaching the team on working cross-functionally
* organizing lunch & learns
* convening discussions about standards and conventions to address code quality
* delivering working code each iteration / sprint
* examining the teams practices looking for ways to improve
* proposing changes to processes and practices to facilitate team improvement
* task walls and a pull system for tasks
* initiating code katas & &eacute;tudes
* looking for patterns of problems in the code
* organizing and running team retrospectives
* encouraging junior developers to take the lead on all of the aforementioned responsibilities
* ensuring that a team hierarchy / pecking order is not forming

####Is there Overlap?
In some cases you may find the current senior developers are also the ones best suited for coaching and mentoring. However, in a lot of situations this is not the case. While not exactly mutually exclusive, the skills that make a developer good at working alone and getting a lot of work done are not the same people skills that a developer is going to need to be a great coach and mentor. In these cases the organization is in a challenging position where it has to start rewarding a totally different set of behaviors than it has previously.

> Your senior people - not always the ones you thought were the senior people - now have an additional responsibility: bringing the less experienced people up to full speed. A highly paid expert shouldn't be highly paid just because she's an expert. She should be highly paid because she is helping other people become experts.

##Technical Leads / Project Leads
Slightly more controversial is the role of a technical lead. Once an organization has adapoted agile practices making a single person the "lead" of the group undermines a lot of the benefits the agile practices can provide. There are three agile practices in particular that I want to discuss. These are **self organizing teams**,  **cross-functional teams**, and **retrospectives**. 

###Self Organizing Teams


###Cross-Functional Teams

###Retrospectives

When a single person is the lead, whether it be a developer who is the technical lead or a business analyst / project manager who is considered the team lead, teams can no longer self organize.

Cross-functional teams cannot truly be cross functional once a team lead is in place. When a project manager leads the team schedule becomes the highest priority and code quality tends to deteriorate. When a specific developer is appointed as technical lead, technical decisions don't get made without her buy in. This creates an environment where other developers stop growing as a single developer makes all of the "important" decisions about the software. Whether that is design, larger refactorings, architecture, etc.

Retrospectives become inaffective if the team cannot work together to solve their problems. In the case where the lead needs to agree to or, worse yet, be the source of all improvements the retrospective is just going through the motions and a wasted effort. One of the great benefits of retrospectives is that they promote trust within the organization and allow teams who don't necessarily work well together the opportunities to learn how to work and solve problems as a team.  Calling a single person out to identify the problems and/or solve the problems robs the teams of these opportuntities.
