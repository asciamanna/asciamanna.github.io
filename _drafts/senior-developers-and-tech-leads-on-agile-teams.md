As development organizations adopt agile software development practices the roles of technical lead and senior developer change dramatically. It is very common for organizations to hold on to these previous conceptions of the roles and responsibilities of the people in those roles. Trying to transform a development team into an agile team and not changing these roles accordingly will hold back the full potential of the team. In doing so these teams will not realize their full potential. They will not be as effective and efficient as they could be.

##Senior Developers
###The Ones Who Get the Most Done
Prior to and organization adopting agile practices development teams typically have individual work assignments. It is easy to see how much work one developer is completing versus another. I'm not saying this is a good metric for comparison mind you. I'm just saying when there are individual work assignments, the person doing the work is visible outside of the development team. Because of this the developers who get the most work done tend to be ones rewarded and the ones who are viewed as the senior developers in the organization.

###Agile Senior Developers - Coaches & Mentors
Once an organization adopts agile development practices getting the most done is __*NOT*__ the most important quality of a senior developer. The senior developers are the ones who are coaching and mentoring the other developers on the team. In addition to "getting work done," they are spending a significant part of their day coaching and mentoring. Listed below are responsibilities I would expect of senior developers on agile teams. I am combining some of my own with some responsibilities that [Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/ "Esther Derby's website") describes in her post, [But are they Working Hard?](http://www.estherderby.com/2012/02/but-are-they-working-hard.html)

####Responsibilities
* pair programming with other developers
* coaching the team on the technology used
* coaching the team on the domain and domain concepts
* coaching the team on working cross-functionally
* organizing lunch & learns
* convening discussions about standards and conventions to address code quality
* delivering working code each iteration / sprint
* examining the teams practices and looking for ways to improve
* task walls and a pull system for tasks
* initiating code katas & &eacute;tudes
* looking for patterns of problems in the code
* encouraging junior developers to take the lead on all of these responsibilities
* ensure that a team hierarchy / pecking order is not being formed

####Is there Overlap?
In some cases you may find the current senior developers are also the ones best suited for coaching and mentoring.  However, in a lot of situations this is not the case. While not mutually exclusive the skills that make a developer good at working alone and getting a lot of work done are not the same people skills that a developer is going to need to be a great coach and mentor.

In these cases the organization is in a challenging position where it has to start rewarding a totally different set of behaviors than it has previously. However, without the coaching the team will not achieve its full potential.

> Your senior people — not always the ones you thought were the senior people — now have an additional responsibility: bringing the less experienced people up to full speed. A highly paid expert shouldn’t be highly paid just because she’s an expert. She should be highly paid because she is helping other people become experts.
