The most effective form of Pair Programming I've experienced is called Ping Pong Pair Programming. I find it so effective that I prefer not to pair at all if I cannot ping pong program. The vast majority of development teams who claim to occasionally pair program don't practice ping pong pair programming. I suspect these teams would enjoy pair programming more and identify its benefits if they tried ping pong pairing.

I first heard of Ping Pong Pair Programming around 2005 or 2006. I have no idea where it originated but have read about it as far back as 2002. 

I didn't begin to practice Ping Pong Programming until I joined an eXtreme Programming (XP) team in 2008. I quickly took to the practice, finding it incredibly engaging and enjoyable. As someone who values collaborating with other developers this was collaborating at a level I had never previously experienced.  Further, this constant and close collaboration built a camaraderie with a team of developers which I have never been able to replicate. There are about eight to ten developers with whom I've worked that I feel an incredible bond with as a result of constant pair programming over a significant period of time. These are folks I would jump at the chance to work with again.

Intersection of TDD and Pair Programming
Ping Pong Pair Programming is the intersection of two XP practices:

* Pair Programming
* Test-driven Development

Hyper learning

Not a silver bullet
Devs who don't like pairing
