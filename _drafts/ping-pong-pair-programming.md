The most effective form of Pair Programming I've encountered is called Ping Pong Pair Programming. I find it so effective that I prefer not to pair at all if I cannot ping pong program. Most development organizations that say they pair program tend not to ping pong pair program, so I'd like to describe it in this post.

I first heard of Ping Pong Pair Programming around 2005 or 2006. I really have no idea where it originated or who originated it.  If anyone knows the history of Ping Pong Pair Programming I'd love to hear about it and I'd gladly update this post with information. 

I didn't begin to practice Ping Pong Programming until I joined an eXtreme Programming team (XP) team in 2008. I quickly took to the practice, finding it incredibly engaging and enjoyable. As someone who values collaborating with other developers this was collaborating at a level I had never previously experienced.  Further, this constant and close collaboration build a camaraderie with a team of developers which I have never been able to replicate. I would say there are about eight to ten developers whom I've worked with that I feel an incredible bond with as a result of constant pair programming over a significant period of time. These are folks I would jump at the chance to work with again.
