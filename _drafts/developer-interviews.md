A development organization's interview process is possibly the most important thing to get right. It is the first impression that the company is giving prospective employees. If all else fails and you have a good hiring practice, you can rely on a great team to address the issues in the organization. The XP team I worked on had the best hiring practice I have experienced and one that, when followed, did not fail us. When we were able to hire without interference every developer we brought into the organization turned out to be fantastic. It was a process that we constantly tuned and I'd like to describe it here in it's final state before it was changed by the larger organization. 

## Team Owned
The most important part of the process was that it was team owned. We were organized by product, which meant that the teams owned their codebase and also owned their hiring process. This is very important that everyone has a say in which developers join the team. It wasn't a subset of the team who had a say in who got hired, the entire development team who would be working with this person had a say in whether they got hired. Once brought onboard, the team was committed to the new hire because it was a decision that they made together. So many times in my career I have seen managers or organizational leaders do all of the interviewing and drop developers into highly functioning teams.  Every time this happens it is a gamble. It may pay off and the candidate may be a great fit. However, you are just as likely to have a bad fit which will have disasterous affects on the team morale and the product.  These decisions are too important to be left to chance.

## Know Your Values
As I've mentioned in a previous post it is important for teams to hire based on their team values. And it is just as important to make those known during the interview process. **It is no coincidence that the team I worked on with the best interviewing process also had a very clear set of team principles, values, and practices.**

## Can the Candidate Program?
Figuring out the candidates software development skills is one of the biggest challenges in developer interviews. Steve Yegge wrote a very detailed article on developer interviews about ten years ago.  I remember going through those types of interviews and even tailoring my interviews with his advice. While I think there was a lot of good ideas in his article the types of technical questions never sat well with me.  

Determining a candidates general development skills, their areas of specialization, and how they will interact with the team is a lot to figure out in a very short amount of time.  I've found fizzbuzz like questions, very targeted technical problems, and logic puzzles all lacking when trying to hire a generalist, full-stack software developer. **The best way to figure out how a candidate will work with your team is to have them work with your team.** This may seem like a silly quip but this approach allowed us to consistently, and without fail, hire great team members after a four hour interview.
