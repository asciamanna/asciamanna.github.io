Recently, I've been discussing developer interviews with my current team. To me an organization's development interview process is possibly the most important thing to get right. It is the first impression that the company is giving prospective employees. If all else fails and you have a good hiring practice, you can rely on a great team to address the issues in the organization. The XP team I worked on had a great hiring practice and one that, when followed, did not fail us. When we were able to hire without interference every developer we brought into the organization turned out to be fantastic. It was a process that we constantly tuned and I'd like to describe it here in it's final state before management in the organization changed it.

##Team Owned
The most important part of the process was that it was team owned. We were organization by product, which meant that the teams owned their codebase and also owned their hiring process. This is very important that everyone has a say in which developers join the team. It wasn't a subset of the team who had a say in who got hired, the entire development team who would be working with this person had a say in whether they got hired.

##Know Your Values
Mentioned in previous post hire based on team values. Make those known during the interview process.
