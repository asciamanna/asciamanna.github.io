Frequent deliveries of working software, acquiring customer feedback, iterating based on that feedback, and the development practices to support these activities are the things I most commonly see missing from poor agile implementations. When I hear developers complain about how much they hate agile software development they are missing these key activities, and typically missing all of these activities.

By contrast XP teams who have embraced agile engineering practices, continuously improve (and change), and consistently iterate on their features based on frequent customer feedback tend to love the way they work. It took me leaving the XP world and joining my first scrum team to finally understand the frustration developers have with agile software development. I know I am not alone in that sentiment having spoken to many XP developers who have gone on to join scrum teams. 

## Software Creation Dissonance

The reason why such a stark difference exists is that when agile is done right it embraces how the world of building software works. Building software is well soft, it's virtual, it's experimental, and it contains lots of unknowns. When software organizations cling to their old manufacturing mindsets they continue to embrace this dissonance. It's impossible to know everything up front but they still batch big deliverables as *projects*. They think that they are successful if they just deliver what the customer asked for so they wait for any feedback for the end of the large project, nevermind that we have decades of evidence that "requirements up front" doesn't work. They oversimplify the challenges of building unknown things and believe that estimates can be translated directly into due dates on Gantt charts, making developers "work harder" if they provided a bad estimate based on a high-level fifteen-minute conversation six months ago. 

A focus on these activities that get feedback often and iterate on it throws all of this old thinking out and embraces how software creation actually works. It embraces the nature of software develoment and that's why developers love it. From first hand experience removing this dissonance creates a low stress and highly productive environment. This leads to happy, productive developers and a better product. Everybody wins!

### Delivering

### Customer Feedback

### Iterating

### Engineering Practices

## The Challenges of Scrum

I don't want to make a Scrum sucks and XP is great argument. I find both valuable but I would chose XP (and what emerged from it in recent years) over Scrum given the choice. There is one really huge challenge with Scrum, its greatest benefit but also it's achilles heel: Teams can start practicing Scrum in a day or two. Scrum ceremonies can be adopted, it can seem like teams are following everything in the Scrum Guide (LINK) but without making a single substantitive change to the way they work. 

Ron Jeffries discusses this in his post, Business Agile: Built on Sand. Teams that practice Scrum and ignore the engineering practices are ignoring half of the story. More dangerously they may be doing more damage to the organization than they have before adopting Scrum.
