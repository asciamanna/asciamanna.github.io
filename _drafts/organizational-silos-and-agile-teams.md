## Organizational Silos

The last thing I wanted to touch on is matrix organizations and organizational silos.
They introduce a different kind of dependency
I often see development organizations where developers, QA, Product Owners, Operations,
UX, etc. all have different reporting structure. The line is always that Agile can work
in any type of reporting structure. However in my twenty years in the industry having
a cross-functional team report up through organizational silos introduces friction at
the team level and reduces the teams ability to work as a team. Often team member's
number one priority is serving their management (who have opposing goals) instead of
delivering high-quality features to customers as quickly and frequently as possible.
