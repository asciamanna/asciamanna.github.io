As a software professional, attending and participating in meetings is something that is impossible to avoid. Given so much time is spent in meetings it is astonishing how truly terrible and ineffective a vast majority of meetings are. They are a blindspot in most organizations. We spend so much of our work life in meetings and yet it seems so little thought is applied to how to make them more effective.

## "Developers Hate Meetings"

Something I've heard regularly throughout my career is the comment that "developers hate meetings." I've always found that comment interesting for a variety of reasons. I've never found that the teams I've worked on hated meetings. However, they did get frustrated by ineffective meetings that took them away from doing work where they are effective. Development teams are producing value when they are creating and deploying software. Now, meetings absolutely play a role in this. However, too many meetings are so poorly planned that they are taking teams away from doing valuable work and are clearly not the best way to communicate information.

One realization I've had is that the same people in the organization that would complain that "developers hated meetings" were the same ones saying that the developers "weren't working fast enough." I've seen this more than once in dysfunctional organizations and found it interesting that making the time spent in meetings more valuable and efficient could go a long way in improving the efficiency of the organization. However, for some reason just telling developers that have to work harder and faster would be considered long before improving and decreasing the frequency of meetings.

### Breaking Silos

As teams move towards real agile software development methodologies the necessity for meetings outside of their cross-functional team decreases. A lot of what would previously happen in meetings is now happening within the team organically without the need for a meeting to hand off information.  Organizational silos love meetings because that's what is required to hand off information. Breaking away from silo-ed organizations into true cross-functional teams alleviates the need for a lot of these meetings.

### The Important Meetings

If a team has embraced agile software development techniques team ceremonies and meetings internal to the cross-functional team are vital. These are the meetings that directly effect the work they are doing on a daily basis. But just because they are important doesn't mean that they shouldn't be optimized. Quite the opposite! These meetings are important so making them effective is equally as important. In addition to the recommendations I am making in this post, there are plenty of resources available if team planning or retrospective meetings are not as valuable as they should be.  

The meetings outside of the cross-functional teams tend to be the most problematic ones. These are the ones I recommend limiting their frequency and making sure that it is absolutely necessary for you to attend.

## Improving Meetings

In this post I wanted to share some things that I've discovered helps make meetings more effective. These are things I've learned from several sources over the course of my career. Recently, I took a leadership course with Cooper Design which discussed a lot of these techniques.

### Be Intentional and Design Each Meeting


### Switch to Asynchronous Communication

So much of what is covered in meetings can be done asynchronously through chat and email. Often we need to document what we talked about in the meeting or follow up with a document. So many times as I am writing up more detailed information that was requested in a meeting I have the realization that the meeting could have been skipped altogether and replaced with the documentation.

As for a detailed agenda for every meeting you are invited to. Try to document the information you would have provided in the meeting and send it to the meeting organizer. Ask if there is any more information the organizer needs and if not skip the meeting. Trying to avoid unnecessary meetings and responding to their requests asynchronously can yield huge improvements for you and your team.

### Provide Detailed Agendas
People can not come if they don't think they will be valuable.
No Mandatory meetings
As a participant skip the meeting w/o an agenda

### Don't Ever Go Overtime

Time the meeting

### Stick to the agenda
Moderate the meeting
hats
no but, yes and, etc.

### keep them short

### Encourage participation

Quote 37% of employee time is spent in meetings
47% think meetings are a waste of time
