As a software professional, attending and participating in meetings is something that is impossible to avoid. Given so much time is spent
in meetings it is astonishing how truly terrible and ineffective a vast majority of meetings are. They are a blindspot in most organizations. 
Something that appears to be required and very little thought is applied to how to make them more effective.

## Why the Hate? 
Something I've heard regularly throughout my career is the comment that developers hate meetings. I've always found that comment interesting for 
a variety of reasons. I never found that the teams I worked on hated meetings. But they did get frustrated by ineffective meetings that took them away
from work. Development teams are producing value while they are building and deploying software. Now, meetings absolutely play a role in this.
But the time spent in meetings is time where teams aren't building software. As teams move towards real agile software development methodologies,
the necessity for meetings outside of their cross-functional team decreases. A lot of what would previously happen in meetings is now happening within
the team organically without the need for a meeting to hand off information. 

Organizational silos love meetings because that's what is required to hand off information. Breaking away from siloed organizations into true
cross-functional teams alleviates the need for a lot of these times of meetings.

One interesting realization I had was that people in the organization that would complain that "developers hated meetings" were the same ones
saying that the developers "weren't working fast enough." I've seen this more than once in dysfunctional organizations and found it interesting
that making the time spent in meetings more valuable and efficient could go a long way in improving the efficiency of the organization.

In this post I wanted to share some things that I've discovered helps make meetings more effective. These are things I've learned from several sources
over the course of my career. Recently, I took a leadership course with Cooper Design which discussed some of these techniques. 

## The Good Meetings
If a team has embraced agile software development techniques team ceremonies and meetings internal to the cross-functional team are vital. 
These are the meetings that directly effect the work they are doing on a daily basis. But just because they are important doesn't mean that
they shouldn't be optimized. Quite the opposite! These meetings are important so it is important to ensure that they are most effective. 

The meetings outside of the cross-functional teams tend to be the most problematic ones. These are the ones I recommend trying to avoid if possible.

## Switch to Asynchronous Communication
so much of what is covered in meetings can be done asynchronously through chat and email.
often we need to document what we talked about in the meeting or follow up with a document. start with asking for an agenda and respond
to agenda with an email.  Try to avoid the meeting if possible since it will force you to stop what you are doing instead of replying when
it is convenient for you.

## Provide Detailed Agendas
People can not come if they don't think they will be valuable.
No Mandatory meetings
As a participant skip the meeting w/o an agenda

## Don't go past time

Time the meeting

## Stick to the agenda
Moderate the meeting
hats
no but, yes and, etc.
