In my experience development coaching I have noticed a trend in software development teams. The vast majority of development teams have limited (if any) experience in collaborative software development practices. These same teams often believe they are great or even expert collaborators, giving themselves expert-level ratings in surveys. These teams often conflate coordinated efforts and cooperative team members with collaboration. The many benefits of collaborative development practices are impossible to ignore, so I find it important to align on the definition of collaboration with teams when I begin working with them. 


It is one of the first things I do with teams now is align on a definition of collaboration so we can discuss its benefits and whether the team wants to learn collaborative development practices.

## Benefits of Collaboration

### Decrease WIP

### Decrease Cycle Time (Improves Delivery Times)
Remove hand offs in development cycle - QA and Product

### Shared Cognitive Load (Check the beyond legacy code book)

### Combined Learning & Knowledge Sharing

### Shift Left Quality

### Improved Communication

### Source of Innovation

## Shifting to Collaboration
Lyssa adkins has advice on shifting teams to collaboration in her book, Coaching Agile Teams. Her advice is fantastic, but I would add to that one critical practice: Mob Programming. When teams experience the benefits of Mob Programming first-hand they realize the benefits of truly collaborative development practices and will make that switch from siloed individual work much faster. 

## Not a One-Size-Fits All Solution
Like nearly everything in software development there is no "best practice" that can be applied regardless of context. Some teams choose to mob program on 100% of their work and that works out well for them. Other teams choose to mob as well as work individually and that works for them. One thing is for certain, gaining collaborative development skills is not a wasted effort. Knowing how and when to collaborate and mob program is a beneficial skill, and the improvement of the team's communication is substantial.
