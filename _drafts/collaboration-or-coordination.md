In the time that I've spent coaching development teams I've seen a common trend. The vast majority of development teams have limited (if any) experience in collaborative software development practices. These same teams often believe they are great or even expert collaborators, giving themselves expert-level ratings in surveys. These teams often conflate coordinated efforts and cooperative team members with collaboration. It is common for teams to disregard collaborative development practices like pair or mob programming because they have individual work assignments, but still regard themselves as expert collaborators. The benefits of collaborative development practices are impossible to ignore, so I find it important to align on the definition of collaboration with teams when I begin working with them. 

## Emergence is the Differentiator
Lyssa Adkins describes collaboration in her book, Coaching Agile Teams. In it she states that emergence is the key differentiator between cooperating and collaborating teams. 

> When a property of a system cannot be traced back to any of the individual parts in the system, it is called an emergent property. Your personality is an emergent property of your brain. it cannot be traced back to inividual neurons.  
> &mdash;_**Jurgen Appelo**_

When teams collaborate, ideas that emerge are the result of the group and cannot be traced back to an individual. The group builds on each others ideas creating something that didn't come out of a single person's head. 

## A Tale of Two Frameworks 
Scrum, without additional practices, builds in coordination. The various scrum events allow for the coordination of work so that individuals can continue to work by themselves and smooth (but not elimaineate) handoffs. By itself it does not promote collaboration. By contrast, XP builds in collaboration with practices like pair and mob programming and collective code ownership. It is my experience that anyone who has come from an XP background or has applied the XP pracitces for any length of time has a much more accurate view of what team collaboration looks like and recognizes its benefits.

This cargo-cult approach to collaboration doesn't work with humans...Deliberately cultivating the dynamics of an effective organiztaion takes a lot more work and a lot more skill than just putting a group of people check by jowl and calling them a team.

## Benefits of Collaboration
The benefits of collaborative development practices make a strong case for helping teams get past coordinating and to actual collaboration. 

### Decrease in WIP
Naturally the more collaborative work the team does work-in-progress (WIP) will begin to decrease. Decreasing WIP results in improvements in both lead time (see Little's Law) and quality. 

### Reduction in Cycle Time
When peoplpe collaborate on work handoffs can be eliminated or reduced. When handoffs are removed work no longer queues and accumulates as inventory. This will reduce cycle time that will as a result improve the delivery timelines.

### Shared Cognitive Load

### Improved Communication

## Shifting to Collaboration
Lyssa Adkins has advice on shifting teams to collaboration in her book, Coaching Agile Teams. Her advice is fantastic, but I would add one critical practice: Mob or Ensemble Programming. When teams experience the benefits of Mob Programming first-hand they realize the benefits of truly collaborative development practices and will make that switch from siloed individual work much faster.
