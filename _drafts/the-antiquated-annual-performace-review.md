On agile software development teams individuals are expected to work very closely together. To collaborate on all work to accomplish team and organizational goals together. Now some teams just give lip service to this collaboration and work together about as much as they always have (which is to say not that much). These teams are practicing what [Ron Jeffries](http://www.ronjeffries.com) calls "Business Agile" in a recent article. I'll discuss that in more detail in a future post. 

For the teams that are collaborating well we say things like _"there are no individual work assignments"_ or _"we succeed and fail as a team"_, but then once per year we rely on antiquated techniques to judge these software professionals individually based on individual goals. In the twenty years I have worked in the industry I have continuously seen this dissonance lead to dysfunction on the teams. Every company I've worked for had a corporate value of teamwork or collaboration and in those companies individuals were put in competition with each other for the annual performance review and its resulting pay increase. 

In these organizations the individuals are forced to compete with each other, sometimes overtly and sometimes not, because _"everyone can't be exceptional"_. At some level in the organization the individual ratings need to form a bell curve. Time and time again I find these techniques to cause problems on teams, creating distractions, and interfering with real collaboration. These goals turn into a box checking exercise instead of focusing the team on delighting customers and increasing customer value. 

## Not Measuring what Matters  

One of the reasons this happens is that something has to be observed and measured to be attributed to an individual. There is no way to map a developer's individual actions to a favorable business outcome because software is not an individual sport, we rely on cross-functional teams to deliver software. A favorable business outcome is a combination of the business, technology, marketing, etc. all working together. So instead managers often rely on judging individual actions that they believe will contribute to these desired outcomes. Unfortunately, this too is wrong. 

## Software Teams are Complex Systems

Individual performance is not an indicator of improved teamwork, nor is improved teamwork an indicator of improved value delivered to our customers (i.e., the case of doing the wrong things faster or better) or increased revenue for the company. In fact most performance issues stem from system problems:

    * How teams are organized
    * How the application is organized 
    * The development process and practices 
And much less from _"low performing individuals"_. In fact it's organizational leadership, and not the individual,who are empowered to improve the system of work. So in essence individuals are often held accountable for poor performance that is leadership's responsibility to improve. 

Rating individuals is based on the incorrect assumption that individual improvement makes the entire system improve, however for software teams (that are complex systems) the way the team works and interacts has a far greater impact on their performance than any one individual.

Jurgen Apello – Pioneering Management in Creative Organizations

From his book Management 3.0
Many experts acknowledge and agree that a lot of damage can be created by merit raises, incentive pay, and bonuses: 
Deming believed that every business is a system, and the performance of individuals is largely the result of the way the system operates. In his view, the system causes 80 percent (other sources claim an even higher percentage) of problems in a business, and the system is management’s responsibility. He wrote that using exhortations and incentives to get individuals to solve management problems simply does not work. Deming opposed ranking because it destroys pride in workmanship, and he opposed merit raises because they address the symptoms, rather than the causes, of problems.

Extrinsic motivation (e.g., merit pay) is a problem because of the nonlinear behavior of complex adaptive systems (software organizations / teams). The pushing and prodding of individual elements in such a system has unexpected consequences and side effects that are (for someone outside the system) often too complex to be foreseen.

Jurgen Apello - Performance Appraisals chapter from Managing for Happiness

Performance appraisals have a terrible track record. While most companies appear to use them, a great majority of people find them completely useless and often counterproductive. A significant body of research confirms that performance appraisals usually destroy intrinsic motivation and team collaboration. This typically stressful annual ritual of appraisals almost always fails for a number of reasons: The employee and manager have opposite mindsets; pay often has nothing to do with performance; no manager can ever be objective; the performance checklists are too generic; the evaluations create distrust; and individual evaluations destroy teamwork. Many managers seem to have at least an idea that something’s wrong because, second only to firing employees, they hate performance appraisals the most.

Nobody has been able to supply evidence that appraisals will help organizations improve their performance in the long term. Most managers and HR professionals just take them or granted without truly thinking about their many hidden assumptions. If performance appraisals were themselves subject to a performance appraisal, they would be fired on the spot for complete lack of any concrete results. Worst of all, they reinforce the hierarchy that modern organizations should try to get rid of.

Fortunately, the world is slowly waking up. One by one, both small and big organizations are getting rid of performance appraisals. One main reason is that the practices is unsustainable in light of the emerging globalized creative economy. Remote working, contract workers, agile and lean methods, and many other trends make it more and more difficult to organize formal performance evaluations between “superiors” and their “subordinates.” (Case in point: My spouse hasn’t had any recent performance appraisals because he’s always away from the head office!) Better to get rid of this useless ritual completely and replace appraisals with something that makes more sense in the twenty-first century.

Jurgen Appelo – From his book Managing for Happiness

Unfortunately, when managers to continue to view the organization as a hierarchy, they usually try to impose goals and metrics on every part of the system. But in complex systems, performance is usually found in the relationships between the parts, and proper goals and metrics can only emerge from intelligent local interaction, not as part of a top-down target-setting framework
