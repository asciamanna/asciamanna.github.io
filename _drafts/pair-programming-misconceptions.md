Pair Programming has increased in awareness with it's inclusion as one of the twelve core eXtreme Programming (XP) practices. However after two decades of XP, Pair Programming remains misunderstood and under utilized by agile software teams. In this post I am going to discuss the misconceptions about Pair Programming. In a follow-up post I will discuss the benefits of the approach and how to sell the practice to organizations that have doubts about its merits. I recommend it as an essential practice for modern development teams. Hopefully, dispelling some of the myths and misconceptions and focusing on its benefits will encourage more organizations to not only try, but master this practice. 

I group the misconceptions into two categories. Both of these have their genesis in old Information Technology (IT) practices that treat software development like manufacturing / factory work. As organizations are slow to change their mindsets about these things some of these beliefs still take hold of organizational processes and prevent companies from achieving excellence. Creating great software is a process of discovery and like most knowledge work, it is a creative endeavor. We need to start shedding these old beliefs to achieve better outcomes for our costumers.

## The Manufacturing Mindset

The most common argument against Pair Programming is the belief that it is two people doing the work of one person. Therefore it must reduce the productivity of the team by 50%, so people assume it is a mostly wasteful practice. I have heard this argument about Pair Programming so many times I have lost count. If organizations continue to measure the value of software development in output they will most likely avoid a practice like Pair Programming (although studies have shown that it does not reduce team's output). When optimizing for developer busyness, measuring a team by velocity, and aiming for 100% utilization of "development resources" organizations are unlikely to try Pair Programming. 

### The Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming

Agile Manifesto co-author Alistair Cockburn and Laurie Williams published a study, [the Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF) in 2000. In the paper they describe that there was not a 50% decrease in team productivity, as one would assume if *"two people were doing the work of one."* What they did find was that there was an increase of 15% in development program hours for teams who pair. However, there was a reduction in bugs escaping to production, an increase in the quality of the code, and other benefits (that will be mentioned in a future post) that more than made up for the 15% increase in hours. 

If we shift the measure of team success from output to favorable business outcomes there is a strong case for pair programming. It typically results in getting individual features to production faster given the higher quality code it yields and its support in limiting work in progress at the team level.

## Selective Pair Programming

The other misconception that I often hear typically comes from developers. It is the idea of "Selective Pair Programming" or sometimes it's referred to as "Pragmatic Pair Programming." The thought is that the XP ideas around pair programming are too prescriptive and teams will instead *"pair when it's appropriate."* The problem with this is that it assumes that developers automatically know how to pair without ever having done it. These teams reserve pair programming for only very specific circumstances, like onboarding a new developer or helping a teammate out when that person gets stuck. 

These teams that selectively pair program often make remarks like *"we wouldn't pair on everything...only when it makes sense, where it is appropriate"* insinuating that somehow pairing more often then what they feel is correct is somehow unprofessional. Unfortunately pairing when someone gets stuck is not how I define pair programming (and I think the XP founders would agree with me). I expect a high amount of collaboration on teams and pairing on the typical work that happens on a team is way to achieve that.

### Pairing takes Practice

Pair programming is a deceptively challenging technique and it, like all other practices, requires consistent practice to improve. Teams who only pair in very specific circumstances never gain the skills required for effective pairing. This results in them doing it less. The less they do it the less useful it is for them. This creates a vicious circle on teams and the team's never get to realize the benefits of pair programming.

### A Nuanced View

On the surface I would agree with the idea that teams shouldn't be required to pair on 100% of their work. However, my view of how much teams should pair and the view of developers who have not mastered pair programming is very different. I would consider pairing time somewhere around 80% or more for a team, where a vast majority of the work would get paired on. For a team that is just learning these practices, I would expect something much higher and closer to 100% until they begin to master the practice.  

The teams I see that claim to selectively pair program tend to pair much less than this, somewhere in the 20% or less range. It is interesting when I observe teams who find the idea of pair programming the way its described in XP as too prescriptive, I don't see much collaboration happening. These "selective pairing" teams have their headphones on and their faces buried in their monitors. It is certainly not the level of collaboration I would expect from a modern, agile software team. These teams end up missing a huge number of benefits that come from pair programming and team collaboration. 

## Conclusion 

Pair Programming is one of the most valuable software development techniques but there still remains a lot of myths and misconceptions about it. It's important to start dispelling these misconceptions so that teams can learn how to do it effectively. When making a case for pair programming I find it useful to both understand the misconceptions around it, but also to be able to articulate the laundry list of benefits to the software team and the larger development organization. Those benefits will be discussed in the next post.
