I was honored to be asked to speak at the [Heart of Agile Pittsburgh 2017](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/)
on April 27 & 28. This is the second year of conference, the last one
was held in Philadelphia. The turn out this year in Pittsburgh was fantastic, selling
out just before the conference start.

## What is the Heart of Agile?

[The Heart of Agile](http://heartofagile.com/) comes from agile manifesto author,
[Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/). As he encouraged people and teams to
get back to the heart of agile he found himself emphasizing four things

* Collaborate
* Deliver
* Reflect
* Improve

I recommend everyone learn about the [Heart of Agile](http://heartofagile.com/).
Especially if you feel, like me, that the current state of
"agile implementations" often end up becoming exactly what the agile movement was
trying to prevent from the onset.

## Talk

My talk was based on a blog post I wrote two years ago about Ping Pong Pair Programming, which
can be found [here](/2015/04/18/ping-pong-pair-programming.html). The talk describes issues
with traditional pair programming, how Ping Pong Pair Programming addresses those issues,
and a demo of Ping Pong Pair Programming. My friend and colleague [Nick Goede](http://nickgoede.com)
gave the talk and demonstration with me.  

Here are the slides from the talk, replacing the coding videos with links to youtube videos.

## Conference

The conference was really well done, hats off to
[Rob Lingle](https://twitter.com/lingle_r412) and [James Gifford](https://twitter.com/scrummando)
for all their hard work organizing it. There were some very unique aspects to
the conference, starting with the location. The conference was held on a series of
docked riverboats, the [Gateway Clipper Fleet](https://www.gatewayclipper.com/).
During the first evening's networking & cocktail reception a riverboat set sail on the Three Rivers.

Other unique aspects of the conference were a real-time retrospective during the
conference (thanks to [ScatterSpoke](http://www.scatterspoke.com)) and a
"coaches corner" where people could meet and discuss topics with speakers,
sponsors, and other attendees. I met more wonderful people and got more value
and inspiration out of this conference than most I have attended. The other
speakers were excellent, I found each of the talks I went to very valuable.
I'm already looking forward to next year's conference.
