If frequently comes as a surprise to development teams when I describe that a team can work without accumulating bugs making things like bug and issue tracking software completely unnecessary. Having luckily been able to work on a mature eXtreme Programming (XP) team, I got to experience this first hand. 

The way to make this a reality is to focus on discipline, practice, and attitude. If your team chooses to not accept bugs, fix bug breeding grounds, and adopt practices that prevent them, you will be surprised how quickly bugs are a thing of the past. It's not to say that bugs don't ever come up, there is no silver bullet in software development. But when bugs do appear, they are fixed quickly and the same kind of bug doesn't occur again.

## Internal Quality

There are several practices that support building software quality in first and not relying on QA departments to find all of the problems. Further, QA focuses on external quality, or quality that only your users will see. No Bugs practices focus on both internal and external quality. Internal quality is the quality of the code, or how amenable to change the code is. In other words, the quality your users do not see. 

There are two important reasons to focus on internal quality first:

* High internal quality often results in high external quality
* High internal quality yields more productive teams
