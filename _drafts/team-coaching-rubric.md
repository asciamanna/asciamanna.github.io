While working with Industrial Logic consultants coaching teams we were faced with a dilemma. We had a organization of over thirty teams and we needed a way to determine an order to coach them. We planned to spend several months embedded with teams teaching them modern agile software development practices. The engineering organization struggled with following "Scrum by the books" which really meant trying to practice scrum in an organization that thought only the engineers needed to work differently in an agile transformation. So the organization relied on traditional projects and traditional project management. What resulted was teams dealing with the problems of running "Scrummerfall" missing the benefits of agile, and doing something that was scrum in name only. 
As is common in most poor agile implementations the agile engineering practices were mostly absent and certainly not supported by the organization.
