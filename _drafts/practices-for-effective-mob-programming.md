I've been fortunate to coach with [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com) consultants [Tim Ottinger](https://www.twitter.com/tottinge) and [Michael Rieser](https://twitter.com/MichaelRieser) for the last several months. Part of this coaching is introducing teams to Mob Programming. As word spread in the organization other teams became interested in mob programming. Without the benefit of going through an Industrial Logic workshop that focuses on Mob Programming they asked for a primer on effective Mob Programming Practices.

The topics in this post come from a conversation [Tim Ottinger](https://www.twitter.com/tottinge) and I had with a team. All of these practices are taught via the Industrial Logic workshop.  

## Use a Mob Programming Tool
Use Mobster (http://mobster.cc/)
Encourages regular switching a break taking

### Seven Minute Timer
We've found that seven minutes seems to be the optimal time to switch drivers in a mob session with six to eight people. This can be modified in mobster to tune to your mob session and number of people taking part in it

### Disciplined Break Taking
An important aspect of Mob Programming is the inclusion of the Pomodoro technique and disciplined break taking. Being disciplined about taking frequent breaks helps the mob stay focused and perform at their best

It also has the side benefit of encouraging TDD and small, incremental development techniques. If developers work in big batches and keep the entire state of the system in their head they will struggle with disciplined break taking.

## Strong style pairing driver/navigator model

The person driving is not coding - they are operating the machine. This opens up the opportunity for everyone on the team to take part in the mob. 

## Encourage Full Team Participation
### Introduces WIP limits
### Increases FTT and Cycle Time 
work never goes backwards on a board - todo / dev / test / PO signoff / done - influenced by decades of waterfall development

### Single Piece Flow
Value single piece flow over optimizing for busyness

## Waste Snake
Document impediments and waste. People tend to workaround waste and waits - when entire team is stuck less likely to deal with it. Unfortunatley working alone and in silos encourages accepting (instead of attacking) waste in the process. Instead we pick up additional work in silos increasing WIP and reducing overall productivity

## Learnings Board

## Avoid Runaway

## Debate In Code

## Shared Team Settings

## Promise Debt

## Invite Experts

## Remote Tools

## Invite the Boss(es)
