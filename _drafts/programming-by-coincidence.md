As a software development consultant I join teams to help them develop modern software development practices and processes. This often includes helping them get to Continuous Delivery. In order to do so they need to shed common habits that get in their way. One in particular is _Programming by Coincidence_. I've commonly seen this nefarious practice prevent teams from getting very far in their advancement. It is important to be able to spot this practice and help reverse its negative impact on codebases and modern collaborative development practices.
