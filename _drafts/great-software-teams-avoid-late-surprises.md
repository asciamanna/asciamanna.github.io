A common mistake I see software organizations making is conflating principles with process. They think if they adopt a recommended process and implement it exactly by the books, usually with the help of a consulting firm, they will find success. Unfortunatley, the 20 plus years since the signing of the agile manifesto has taught us that bad agile is much more common than truly successful agile teams. A primary reason for this is that many organizations adopt prescriptive "agile processes" and expect to get the benefits as described in books and by agile leaders. 

Software development is complex knowledge work, and as a result context-free process can only take a team so far. I'm not saying that some prescriptive processes don't help teams improve. Usually, any organizational focus on process can help teams that are really struggling. If the goal is to build great, innovative software development teams, the kinds that people really want to work for and with, then prescriptive frameworks aren't going to get you there. To put it bluntly, following Scrum "by the books" or (god forbid) something heavy-weight and extremely prescriptive like SAFe is not going to help create a great software organization. Your context **IS** the important part. However, you can learn about successful development team principles and learn how to apply them to you context. One such principle I've found on the most successful teams is _avoiding late surprises._

If we want to build teams that can not only be resilient but welcoming to change they need to be able to work in ways that changes don't lead to surprise failures. If we want teams to be able to continuously deliver business value while balancing that with experimentation we need them to work in ways that avoids surprises. Surprises leads to fire-fighting and scrambling. Teams do their worst work under pressure and experimentation and learning is the first thing to be abandoned when teams are under pressure to deliver. 

So, how do great teams avoid late surprises? It is a combination of many practices, let's examine some here:
- Many, short feedback cycles - the shorter the better
- Continuous Integration so that integration risk isn't pushed to delivery time
- Continuous Delivery / Continous Deployment - so small changes can get integrated and deployed as quickly and safely as possible
- Development practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) to enable small, safe changes that can continously be deployed
- Collaborative Development practices - avoiding Scatter-Gather
- Pursue exerpirementation and improvements continuously - not having a process or people outside of the team dictate when improvement or innovation can occur (I'm specifically referring to SAFe's Innovation and Planning Sprints)
