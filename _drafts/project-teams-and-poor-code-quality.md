A large, and often overlooked, impact on code quality is how development teams are organized. Something that I have experienced
on more than one occassion is the software quality issues that arise when teams organize around projects rather than products. 
This is something that I have been concerned with for a number of years, so I happy to see that there is now a "No Projects" movement 
gaining steam in the software industry. With the rise of microservices and some high profile successes that organizations have had 
organizing around products, it seems that the masses are starting to take notice.

###Lack of Code Ownership
###Loss of Institutional Knowledge
###Loss of Design
####No Refactoring
####Large merge conflicts


##Why are Project Teams Popular
One reason that project teams are popular is that on the surface, they make it seem like organizing teams to do new work is easier. It seems
like it is going to make the project manager's job a piece of cake.
Unfortunately, what appears to be less work for project managers in the short-term leads to code quality issues that will make
all future work harder for the entire organization. The idea that a project manager can have some amount of work and just create a team for it out of thin air is a seductive one. And given
that in the software industry project managers tend to have positions of authority over developers (some double as the team manager) it
is no surprise that this way of organizing work is popular.

The often-used argument against this is, *"What if we organize around products and one team has no work for a specific product? That's why
it won't work here!"* This is an argument that is rooted in a project-thinking mindset. As teams coalesce around products and those teams
have dedicated product owners, the team is now responsible for pushing that product forward. Concerns about consistency across product teams
can be addressed by having cross team discussions regularly. The team at Spotify appears to do an especially good job of this.  If a specific product
really does have no work, which is unlikely, products can be shifted.  When products are shifted a team still owns that code and you
still get the benefits of code ownership. While it's not ideal, you are trading some institutional knowledge for team flexibility.
