The past summer I wrote an article for my blog about [the importance of static code analysis](2015-08-30-the-importance-of-static-code-analysis.html). While writing this article I reached out to [Patrick Smacchia](http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/) and the folks at [NDepend](http://www.ndepend.com/). A few months later they approached me about the article being included in an e-book about NDepend. 

I find NDepend an invaluable tool to help increase code quality and help developers improve. NDepend is a powerful tool that can help make good teams great. As I am passionate about improving my own skills as well as helping other developers improve (and consequently the code they work on improve) being asked to participate in this project was very exciting for me.  

The book contains articles from several fantastic writers including Bj√∏rn Einar Bjartnes, Erik Dietrich, Jack Robinson, Prasad Narravula, and Tomasz Jaskula. I am especially honored to be included with Erik Dietrich whose blog I've read for years. He was one of the inspirations for me to start writing about software development. 

Patrick and the folks at NDepend care deeply about developers improving and the industry in general improving the quality of software it produces, so it is an honor to be recognized by them. When you have a moment download and read the free e-book it will be worth your time investment:
