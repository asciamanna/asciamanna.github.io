The world has changed forever as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last decade we've seen an increase in distributed and remote-only development teams as the technology has advanced to support this way of working. While there have been many holdouts, preferring to keep employees working face-to-face in an office environment, the current health crisis has forced these organizations into embracing a remote culture for their development teams. 

When teams go remote one common struggle is staying connected to teach other and collaborating. I've found the most effective team collaboration technique to be mob programming, I can overstate it's importance. Practicing mob programming on a remote team offers some different challenges, but it is worth the effort and challenges but it's worth the time and effort to learn.

Having spent years on Extreme Programming (XP) teams and coaching teams on agile technical practices, I've had a lot of experience with pair programming. I've found it extremely beneficial but also a controversial and misunderstood. Often technical leaders still think that typing is the bottleneck on development teams so that pairing will halve the productivity of the team. I've written about this at length here <LINKE HERE>, but in short this is simply not true and there's been studies that show that collaborative development work produces a better solution, there is less rework, and teams tend to be more productive. 

Mob Programming is a further evolution of the idea of collaborative software development. I find it and Test-Driven Development (which I coach together) to be the most important foundational practices for successful development teams. I've spent years remote pair programming and remote mob programming, and I want to share some of what I've learned. 

If you are new to mob programming the take a look at my post on Mob Programming Practices <>, and you can see a talk that I've given about mob programming here <>. There are a lot of benefits of Mob Programming. I highly recommend reading Woody Zuill, who is one of the creators of Mob Programming, experience report on the practice. In it he describes the ten times productivity improvement the organization had after a year of Mob Programming. 

## Remote is Different

Mob Programming is often described by Woody Zuill as a technique that consists of putting all the brilliant minds working together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. When the same space is a virtual environment we need to adjust some of these practices.
