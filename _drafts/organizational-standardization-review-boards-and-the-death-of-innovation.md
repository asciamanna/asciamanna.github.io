It's really quite simple to destroy innovation, effectiveness, and productivity on software development teams. Make it clear that initiative and experimentation are punishable and move the decision making away from the people building the software.

In most companies organized this way managers and leaders say they want an innovative organization, and they very well might. There is often frustration around why they can't grow their organization and be as effective as companies like Netflix, Etsy, Google, and Amazon. They don't recognize how fundamentally different these companies structure their work and treat their employees. Instead they assume those companies must hire better engineers.

> The more time managers spend communicating and elaborating and being transparent about the job to be done, about the challenges the business is facing and the larger competitive context, the less important policies, approvals, and incentives are.
> _&mdash; Patty McCord, former Chief Talent Officer at Netflix and Author of Powerful; Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility_

The source of the problem lies in actions of company leadership and the old playbook they are still using to manage a software organization. If you strip away the thin veneer of empty company values that always include terms like 'innovative' and start looking at the language used by management, the processes in place, and the system of work it's obvious that company is 'optimized' for anything but innovation.

These companies have leadership and managers who have taken the Frederick Taylor playbook and continue to apply it to creative knowledge work. With the rise of poor Scrum implementations (Command-and-Control waterfall projects wrapped in Scrum terminology) and frameworks like SAFe, the problem persists despite these companies thinking that they are "Agile." In recent years DevOps, Modern Agile, and other movements are helping to correct the course. 

## Agile Teams in Corporate Scrum

One of the key aspects of agile teams is that they are staffed with everyone on the team that can take an idea from formation to delivery. Lean software development calls this taking an idea "from concept to cash." But companies often want the benefits of agile without all of the hard work to transform the company, transform leadership, and upend some company fiefdoms in the process. This results in doing work the same old way, Command-and-Control waterfall organizations adopting the terminology of agile without any of the substance. These same companies are often frustrated that "agile" didn't deliver on its promises.

Companies often build what they believe are cross-functional teams, but these teams must take so much external direction that it serves to stymie all progress they make. This destroys any chance for the team to innovate, rendering them helpless to deliver anything without getting permission to make a change, present to a board to change a standard, try a new tool, etc.

## Decision Makers vs. Workers - Broken Feedback Loops
The crux of this problem is that decision makers are separated from the workers. This takes on several forms. 

### Review Boards & Standards Bodies
When coaching software development teams, one thing I focus on is helping to identify and minimize waste. One of the biggest sources of waste is the unwavering belief that for companies to grow and operate "at scale" an organizational optimization is to enforce organizational standards. This is often done by creating standards bodies, review boards, working groups, etc. This results in several roles to create and manage standards. These board members can't possibly work on every team they are making decisions for. This separation of the decision makers from the workers creates broken feedback loops that slows every team down delivering software for the company.  

The company signals that it values identical teams and organizational sameness over creating empowered, autonomous teams. So it should come as no surprise when morale plummets when the realization sets in that the teams responsible for doing the actual work are just typists, mercenaries doing as they are instructed to the codebase.

Teams of mercenaries feel no real sense of empowerment or accountability, no passion for the problem to be solved, and little real connection with the actual users and customers.

### Architecture and Development Separation

One of the core agile practices is evolutionary design (coming to us from Extreme Programming). An idea related to this emergent and incremental architecture. You don't need an architecture dictated up front but it too can emerge, much like the software design, as the system changes through consistent refactoring. 

I often see waterfall architecture groups organizationally separated from "agile" development teams. The architects dictate the architecture of the system up front but don't get their hands dirty writing any of the software. So the team cannot effectively refactor code and evolve the design if it would affect any of the architecture or high-level design that would be the architect's responsibility. The team's design space is constrained and they learn they can change little things but the big things won't change without a review, so the big issues aren't addressed. 

Since the architect is removed from the day-to-day problems the team is solving, these architects rarely get timely feedback on their architecture and designs as they are not the ones to implement them. 

## An Organization without Innovation

What becomes quite obvious for anyone who has worked in a highly productive learning organization is that companies that centralize standards, decision making, and process change crush innovation. It sends a clear message that innovation and initiative is to be punished not celebrated. 

## Team Apathy
If a team needs to convince organizational leadership, a review board, an architect, or even just the other development teams of the merit of an improvement or experiment, they will simply stop trying to improve. Given the friction involved in getting any change through, teams stop trying to improve the way they work. Over time, the organization ends up creating apathetic teams because they just donâ€™t have the time or energy to deliver on their team commitments and put in the heroic effort necessary to affect change in the organization.

## Lessons of Lean Software Development
One of the many important lessons we've learned from lean is that process improvement should come from the practitioners. Mantras like **_"Move authority to the information"_** exist to remind company leadership that in knowledge work separating decision making from doing the work is a fool's errand. At best it builds a mediocre organization filled with mercenary teams doing exactly as they are told. 

## There is Hope

This may seem depressing but there is hope. The most successful software companies today understand the creative, experimental, and team-based nature of software development, that software development is a process of discovery. The great software companies have adopted principles and practices from DevOps, Lean Software Development, Extreme Programming, and [Modern Agile](http://www.modernagile.org). They instead focus on empowering autonomous teams, technical excellence, continuous experimentation, continuous learning, and discovery rather than building order taking, masters-and-minions organizations, stamping out cookie-cutter teams, and separating the decision makers from the software creators.

## Further Reading
If what I'm saying sounds impossible, I recommend a trio of books. 

### Books 
Mary and Tom Poppendieck's _**Lean Software Development**_ describes how centralized standards result in the opposite of their intended affect. The book is teeming with incredible insights and at the top of my list of recommended reading for software professionals.

Nicole Forsgren (with Jez Humble and Gene Kim) have written _**Accelerate**_ and are responsible for the annual State of DevOps Report. In it they describe studies they've done that indicate that, among other practices, having a low ceremony review like code reviews, pair programming, and mob programming is much more effective than review boards and centralized standards bodies. 

The last book I will recommend is Marty Cagan's _**Inspired**_, in it he describes how these great software companies can maintain an innovativ eculture as they grow.
