##About
<hr/>
I am a software developer with {{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2000}}  years of experience in the industry. I graduated from [Drexel University](http://www.drexel.edu) with a degree in Computer Science. I currently work for [eMoney Advisor](http://www.emoneyadvisor.com) in Conshohocken, PA. View my professional timeline [here](/timeline.html).
<br/><br/>
I'm passionate about eXtreme Programming principles, Test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and software design. I am a strong believer in Software Craftsmanship and a lifelong student always trying to improve my craft. I believe software quality is not subjective or a matter of preference. 
I enjoy coaching and mentoring developers specifically about XP development practices, software quality, unit testing, and Test-driven development.
<br/><br/>
I've developed professionally in C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C++, and Perl.
