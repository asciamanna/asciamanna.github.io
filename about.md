##About
<hr/>
I am a software developer with {{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2000}}  years of experience developing a variety of
applications. My current focus is .NET web technologies and JavaScript.
I'm currently working for [eMoney Advisor](http://www.emoneyadvisor.com) in Conshohocken, PA.
<br/><br/>
I'm passionate about eXtreme Programming (XP) principles, Test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and software design. I am a strong believer in Software Craftsmanship and a lifelong student trying to improve my craft. I believe software quality is not subjective or a matter of preference. I enjoy mentoring junior developers specifically about software quality, unit testing, and Test-driven development.
<br/><br/>
I've developed professionally in C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C++, and Perl.
