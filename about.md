##About
<hr/>
I am a software developer with {{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2000}}  years of experience in the industry. 
I graduated from [Drexel University](http://www.drexel.edu) with a degree in Computer Science. I've previously worked for [Lockheed Martin](http://www.lockheedmartin.com), graduating from their Technical Leadership Program. I've also worked for [Algorithmics](http://www.algorithmics.com), a financial software company. There I was a member of an eXtreme Programming (XP) development team. Algorithmics was subsequently acquired by [IBM](http://www.ibm.com). 

I'm currently working for [eMoney Advisor](http://www.emoneyadvisor.com) in Conshohocken, PA.
<br/><br/>
I'm passionate about eXtreme Programming principles, Test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and software design. I am a strong believer in Software Craftsmanship and a lifelong student always trying to improve my craft. I believe software quality is not subjective or a matter of preference. 
I enjoy coaching and mentoring developers specifically about XP development practices, software quality, unit testing, and Test-driven development.
<br/><br/>
I've developed professionally in C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C++, and Perl.
