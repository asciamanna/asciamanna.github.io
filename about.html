## About

I am a software engineer, software development / technical agile consultant, community organizer and founder of [PhillyXP](https://www.meetup.com/phillyxp), blogger, and [speaker]({{site.baseurl}}{% link talks/index.md %}) with {{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2000}}+ years of experience in the industry. I have specific expertise in:

* Leading and coaching software teams
* Mentoring developers
* Improving development processes and practices for cross-functional development teams
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Microtesting / Unit Testing
* Agile / eXtreme Programming (XP) practices
* Pair & Mob Programming 
* Legacy code rehabilitation 

 I am a lifelong student always trying to improve. I believe code quality is not subjective nor a matter of preference. I enjoy mentoring and coaching developers specifically about code quality, microtesting, and Test-Driven Development. 
 I am passionate about XP, [Modern Agile](http://modernagile.org/), Lean Software Development, and DevOps. A listing of my talks [can be found here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link talks/index.md %}).
