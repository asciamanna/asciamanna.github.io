## About
I am a software developer, engineering coach, hands-on agile coach, community organizer ([PhillyXP](https://www.meetup.com/phillyxp)), blogger, and speaker with {{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2000}}+  
years of experience creating and delivering high quality software. I have specific expertise in:

* Leading and coaching software teams
* Mentoring developers
* Improving development processes and practices for cross-functional development teams
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Microtesting
* Agile / eXtreme Programming practices
* Pair & Mob programming

Iâ€™m passionate about eXtreme Programming (XP) principles, Test-driven development (TDD), and pair programming. I am a strong believer in Software Craftsmanship and a lifelong student always trying to improve my craft. I believe code quality is not subjective or a matter of preference. I enjoy mentoring and coaching developers specifically about code quality, unit testing, and Test-driven development.
