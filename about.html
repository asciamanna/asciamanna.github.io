## About

I am a software engineer, engineering coach, hands-on agile coach, community organizer for [PhillyXP](https://www.meetup.com/phillyxp), blogger, and speaker with {{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2000}}+ years of experience creating and delivering high quality software. I have specific expertise in:

* Leading and coaching software teams
* Mentoring developers
* Improving development processes and practices for cross-functional development teams
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Microtesting
* Agile / eXtreme Programming (XP) practices
* Pair & Mob Programming 

I am a believer in software craft and a lifelong student always trying to improve. I believe code quality is not subjective nor a matter of preference. I enjoy mentoring and coaching developers specifically about code quality, microtesting, and Test-driven development.
