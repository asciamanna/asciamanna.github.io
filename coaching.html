## Coaching

I'm a coach and trainer at [Industrial Logic](https://industriallogic.com). If your software development organization is struggling with quality issues and continuously delivering working software, I can help. 
My focus is on structuring software development teams for fast flow and identifying light-weight processes that can help improve delivery while focusing on technical quality.  <br /><br />
I embed with software development teams to teach and model continuous process improvements and technical practices that result in the continuous improvement of code quality. 

If you are interested in learning more reach out to me [here](/#contact) or on the Industrial Logic [website](https://www.industriallogic.com/people/anthony/).
