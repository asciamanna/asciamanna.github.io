<p>
If you are interested in my blog, agile software development, XP, or helping yourself and your development team continuously improve, please consider signing up for my newsletter.
</p>
<p>
By signing up you will get access to content not available on my blog, early versions of blog posts, relevant articles by others in the industry, and possibly some of my musings about music. 
You can expect relatively low volume, a new newsletter every couple of months. Thank you!
