I've spent the last few years coaching teams and introducing them to Mob Programming. I was fortunate to get to coach with some of the finest technical coaches, [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com) consultants [Tim Ottinger](https://www.twitter.com/tottinge), [Michael Rieser](https://twitter.com/MichaelRieser), [Bill Wake](https://twitter.com/wwake), and [Steve Ropa](https://twitter.com/steveropa). During our time together, coaching over a dozen teams, we've discovered a set of starter practices that help teams find early success with Mob Programming.

 Mob Programming is a fantastic way to teach technical practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), refactoring, legacy code techniques, evolutionary design, etc. Teams adopt these practices quickly and continue to improve through mob programming sessions. More importantly, Mob Programming is a practice that helps teams increase the quality of their work *AND* the quality of their interactions.  

I've written about these recommendations previously in my article, [Effective Practices for Mob Programming]({% post_url 2018-06-29-practices-for-effective-mob-programming %}) and Tim Ottinger published a similar post on the Industrial Logic blog, [A Few Tips for Mob Programming](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/a-few-tips-for-mob-programming/).  


## The Guide

As a companion to mob programming coaching sessions, I created a quick start guide that distills these recommendations into a short one-page poster that can be kept by the team's mobbing workstation.

You can download this quick start guide here:

## Starter Recipes

Remember that these recommendations are to get teams started and find early success with Mob Programming. As you progress with Mob Programming determine what works best for you. [Woody Zuill](https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill/) was the coach for the team at Hunter Industries that first discovered Mob Programming. He often says there are no rules to Mob Programming; instead there is a core idea: _the team's dedication to learning how to work well together_. Through continued inspection and adaptation, you will come to find your own practices that work best for your team.
