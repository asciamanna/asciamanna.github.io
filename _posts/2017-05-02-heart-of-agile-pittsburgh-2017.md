I was honored to be asked to speak at the [Heart of Agile Pittsburgh 2017](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/)
on April 27 & 28.

## What is the Heart of Agile?

[The Heart of Agile](http://heartofagile.com/) comes from agile manifesto author,
[Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/). As he encouraged people and teams to
get back to the heart of agile, he found himself emphasizing four things

* Collaborate
* Deliver
* Reflect
* Improve

I recommend learning about the [Heart of Agile](http://heartofagile.com/).
Especially, if you feel like I do, that agile implementations frequently
end up becoming exactly what the agile movement was
trying to prevent.

## Talk

My talk on Thursday morning was based on a blog post I wrote two years ago about Ping Pong Pair Programming, which
can be found [here](/2015/04/18/ping-pong-pair-programming.html). The talk,
_The Ultimate Developer Collaboration Technique: Ping Pong Pair Programming_, describes issues
with traditional pair programming, how Ping Pong Pair Programming addresses those issues,
and a demo of Ping Pong Pair Programming. I am grateful that my longtime colleague and friend [Nick Goede](http://nickgoede.com) could join me for the talk and demonstration.  

Here are the slides from the talk, replacing the embedded coding videos with links to youtube videos.

## Conference

Hats off to
[Rob Lingle](https://twitter.com/lingle_r412) and [James Gifford](https://twitter.com/scrummando)
for all their hard work organizing the conference. There is an incredible amount of work and
preparation required to organize such an event. There were some very unique aspects to
the conference, starting with the location. It was held on a series of
docked riverboats called the [Gateway Clipper Fleet](https://www.gatewayclipper.com/).
During the first evening's networking & cocktail reception, one of the riverboats set sail on the Three Rivers. Another unique aspect of the conference was a real-time retrospective (thanks to [ScatterSpoke](http://www.scatterspoke.com)).

I met more wonderful people and got more value out of this conference than many I have attended in the past. I am already looking forward to next year. If you are a software professional working in an agile environment do yourself a favor and put this conference on your list for next year.
