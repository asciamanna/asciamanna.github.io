I frequently practice code katas with the development teams I coach and train. I've pulled this list of code kata websites out of my notes a few times in the past month, so I decided to publish this information as a listicle (list article). I've found code katas to be an important practice to help build new skills and establish habits. Practices like Test-Driven Development, refactoring, automated refactoring techniques, and microtesting can all be improved by practicing code katas. Now on to the list.
