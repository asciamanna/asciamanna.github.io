This is the second post in my series about writing effective unit tests. This series covers questions and challenges that typically arise when teams begin unit testing. In the first post I addressed the question [should private methods be tested?](/2016/02/14/should-private-methods-be-tested.html) In this post I'm going to focus on two related issues: refactoring unit tests and avoiding test complexity.

For those new to unit testing it is common to refactor production code, and not apply the same vigor to unit tests. There are several reasons for this. There is a learning curve associated with effective unit testing. Developers almost certainly don't know the common patterns and practices for unit tests when they first start writing them. They are learning as they write unit tests and it tends to show in the quality of these early tests. This is not a bad thing. I continually learn and improve my tests. I've been unit testing for ten years now and my tests today look different than my tests just two months ago. 


Furthermore, developers new to unit testing often work in environments where unit tests aren't treated like first-class citizens (otherwise the organization would have already adopted unit testing as an organizational practice). It is easy in organizations like this to abandon unit testing when under pressure or at least allow the tests to accrue complexity and cruft. I truly believe this is a natural part of learning how to unit test without strong mentoring on the subject. I have experienced this first-hand when learning how to write unit tests myself. 

It is just too easy to fall into the trap and think, ***"This code doesn't get released to production, I have to focus on the production code."*** While this is a common way of thinking, it demonstrates that the developer hasn't yet grasped the strong, symbiotic relationship between unit tests and the production code they support. As a TDD practitioner I don't see a division between production code and unit tests. 

## Clean Tests First
It is vitally important to keep tests clean and apply the same dedication to refactoring unit tests as one would apply to refactoring production code. To get the most value from unit tests they need to be kept clean and extremely simple. They should be optimized for readability above all else. This sentiment is echoed by many experts. Robert Martin talks about this in detail in his post, [Test First](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/09/23/Test-first.html). 

>...we should consider our tests as being first. We already know we should write them first; but we should also clean them first, maintain them first, think of them first, and keep them first. We should give our tests the highest priority.

### Tests are Executable Specs
Remember that one of the great benefits to unit testing that I discussed in the [previous post](/2016/02/14-should-private-methods-be-tested.html) is that unit tests are executable specifications. To utilize this benefit, tests need to be kept clean and simple.

## Refactoring to Simplicity
Once developers are convinced that tests need to be maintained with the same amount of dedication as production code, the next challenge they face is how to refactor tests. While a significant amount of what they've learned about refactoring production code applies, there are nuanced differences that tend to trip developers up. 

**The primary goal of unit test refactoring is to make tests simpler and easier to understand.** If any refactorings lead you away from this you should stop and reconsider the refactoring. For example, if removing duplication leads to adding complexity to the test, I would favor a small amount of duplication if it makes the tests easier to understand.

## Tests are Untested Code!
The reason for this nuanced difference is that tests are untested code. Because of this, tests need to be as simple as possible. Bugs in tests lead to bugs in production code, and bugs in tests are harder to find since they themselves have no tests. Justin Searls talks about this at length in his RubyConf 2015 talk [How to Stop Hating Your Test Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD51AkG8EZw). He describes that, above all else, tests should be obvious and boring.

### Avoid Logic in Tests
One practice to achieve this simplicity is to follow common patterns and conventions in tests, which I'll discuss in detail in the next post. Another practice is to avoid logic in tests altogether. Specifically, tests should not contain any flow control statements (i.e., conditional statements or loops). These types of statements make tests more complicated and are ideal places for bugs to hide. This is another great point Justin Searls made in his recent RubyConf 2015 talk. 

> Logic in tests confuses the story of whatâ€™s being tested.
Test-scoped logic is hard to read and errors are easy to miss.  
> &mdash; _Justin Searls, RubyConf 2015_

When testing production code every branch of a condition needs to be tested. Loops typically require tests that cover not entering the loop at all, as well as, executing logic in the loop at least twice. Executing the loop logic once would be a good test for a conditional statement but not necessarily a loop. These flow control statements go untested in tests!

### Keep Tests Self-Contained
Another practice to keep tests simple is to keep them self-contained. Test logic shouldn't be spread throughout inheritance hierarchies. In fact, **classical inheritance should be avoided altogether in unit tests**. Unit tests using inheritance are usually prime examples of the misuse of inheritance (violating the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)) and make tests much harder to understand. There are some common patterns and heuristics for unit testing that help keep tests self-contained.

Well designed tests should make what is important to the test obvious and use well named, private methods (or methods on other objects) to obscure the unimportant details of a test that are there strictly for test setup. This topic is another great segue into test patterns and heuristics as following them will help keep tests self-contained. The author of _XUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code_ Gerard Meszaros talks about these benefits in his talk at Craft Conf 2014: [Find the Right Abstraction Level for your Tests](http://m.ustream.tv/recorded/46744750).

## Design Flaws 
As I have discussed in [the previous post](/2016/02/14/should-private-methods-be-tested.html), unit tests expose design flaws in the code they test. If I find myself having to add flow control statements to my tests or create an inheritance hierarchy, I try to go back to my production code and see if it can be simplified. In a lot of cases a production code refactoring can avoid these issues entirely. In these cases everybody wins. Tests get simpler and cleaner, production code gets simpler and cleaner, and the tests' intent becomes easier to understand for future developers, including myself!

## Coming Next
The next post in this series will cover following well-known and consistent unit test patterns and heuristics that help achieve a simplicity in unit tests and optimizes for readability.
