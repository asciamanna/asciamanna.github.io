### Creating a new post

Run the ./scripts/newpost script with the file name of the post as an argument:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
cd <your { Personal } repo>
./scripts/newpost hello-world
</code></pre>

A a new post template with name YYYY-MM-DD-hello-world.md will be created under ./\_posts, with the current date.

In the created post, just replace the Title, Category and tags and you can
start writing your post in markdown right bellow the end of the post header.

Every file with the format <i>YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</i> will be processed as a
post, with publication date <i>YYYY-MM-DD</i>.

The content starts with:

<pre><code data-trim class="yaml">
---
layout: post
section-type: post
title: Title
category: Category
tags: [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ]
---
</code></pre>

The *layout* and *section-type* variables are used by the theme and you shouldn't remove them.

### Hashtags

Jekyll generates a static pages.
As a result we have to create the tag pages before building and publishing the site.
In order to generate the tag pages, simply run the *generate-tags* script from the repo's root directory:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
./scripts/generate-tags
</code></pre>

The script will parse all your posts, and generate the tag pages for the newly added tags.

<small>If you are not using GitHub Pages, you can automate the execution of this script during build time.</small>

### Syntax highlighting

If you want to demonstrate source code in your posts, syntax highlighting is provided.
If you want to see how to render your code with the highlight, simply check the source
code of this tutorial post :smile:

<pre><code data-trim class="c">
{% raw %}
int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world of syntax highlighting!");

  return 0;
}
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

<small>If you don't need syntax highlight in your website you can disable it by setting the syntax-highlight variable to False</small>

### Emoji support

You can add emojis to your posts by simply typing their [emoji code](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) :wink:
