## Pair Programming & TDD Workshop
_PhillyXP &bull; October 27, 2017 &bull; Radnor, PA_

Thanks for attending the inaugural meeting of the [PhillyXP](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyXP/) user group. For our first meeting I hosted a talk and workshop about Pair Programming and Test-Driven Development. 

You can view and download the slides from the talk here on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/asciamanna/pair-programming-workshop-phillyxp).

Here is [John Cutler's](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish) article [12 Signs You Are Working in a Feature Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2) that I referenced during the talk.

The code repository used for the workshop can be cloned from [github](https://github.com/PhillyXP/pair-programming-workshop).

I referenced this study by [Alistair Cockburn](https://twitter.com/TotherAlistair) and [Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/), [The Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF). I also mentioned my blog post about [Ping Pong Pair Programming]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-04-18-ping-pong-pair-programming%}).

Since this talk I've written in detail about pair programming. Check out the following articles, [Misconceptions of Pair Programming]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-11-30-misconceptions-of-pair-programming %}) and [The Benefits of Pair Programming]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-12-31-benefits-of-pair-programming %}).
