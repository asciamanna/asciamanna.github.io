### eMoney Advisor - Agile Month - Mob Programming: Whole Team Collaboration 
_September 25, 2018 - Radnor, PA_

Here you will find all of the material referenced in the Mob Programming talk, as well as additional resources to continue learning about mob programming. 

Embed Speakerdeck slides here. 

We would recommend starting with Woody Zuill's Agile Alliance 2014 Experience Report, [Mob Programming - A Whole Team Approach](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/mob-programming-agile2014/). In this report Woody explains how they got to a ten times productivity improvement from mob programming, which was referenced in our talk. 

Tim Ottinger's article [Programming is Mostly Thinking](http://agileotter.blogspot.com/2014/09/programming-is-mostly-thinking.html) is another recommended article where he describes that 1/12th of software development is typing, which helps to explain how mob programming can yield such improvements in productivity.

We reference Lean Software Development several times in our talk. It's worthwhile to take a look at the wikipedia page on [Lean Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development). It will explain, among other things, the eight forms of waste from lean and how they are applied to software development. Additionally, I'd recommend reading Mary and Tom Poppendieck's book, Lean Software Development.

Take a look at the article I wrote about mob programming practices to continue improving and adapting your mob programming sessions, [Practices for Effective Mob Programming]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-06-29-practices-for-effective-mob-programming %}.
