## A Whole Team Approach

We would recommend starting with Woody Zuill's Agile Alliance 2014 Experience Report, [Mob Programming - A Whole Team Approach](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/mob-programming-agile2014/). In this report Woody explains how his team at Hunter Industries achieved a ten times productivity improvement from mob programming.

## Programming Is Mostly Thinking

Tim Ottinger's article [Programming is Mostly Thinking](http://agileotter.blogspot.com/2014/09/programming-is-mostly-thinking.html) is another recommended article where he describes that 1/12th of software development is typing, which helps to explain how mob programming can yield such improvements in productivity described by Woody Zuill.

## Lean Software Development
We reference Lean Software Development several times in our talk. It's worthwhile to take a look at the wikipedia page on [Lean Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development). It will explain, among other things, the eight forms of waste from lean and how they are applied to software development. Additionally, I'd recommend reading Mary and Tom Poppendieck's book, Lean Software Development.

## Disciplined Break Taking

### The Pomodoro Technique

We talk about disciplined break taking as an important aspect of mob programming. Mob Programming incorporates the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) to encourage disciplined break taking. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

The intervals are named __*pomodoros*__ the plural of the Italian word for tomato, named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer. 

### Importance of Disciplined Breaks
Tim Ottinger has written an excellent article about the importance of disciplined breaks in software development. Take a look at, [Taking Breaks in a Disciplined Way](http://agileotter.blogspot.com/2017/11/taking-breaks-in-disciplined-way.html).

## Effective Practices

Take a look at the article I wrote about mob programming practices to continue improving and adapting your mob programming sessions, [Practices for Effective Mob Programming]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-06-29-practices-for-effective-mob-programming %}).
