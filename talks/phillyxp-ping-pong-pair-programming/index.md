_PhillyXP &bull; February 1, 2018 &bull; Radnor, PA_

Thanks for attending (or otherwise being interested) in my [PhillyXP](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyXP/) talk about Ping Pong Pair Programming. [Nick Goede](https://nickgoede.com) and I first gave this talk at [the Heart of Agile - Pittsburgh](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-conferences/heart-of-agile-pittsburgh-2017/) Conference in 2017, and we're happy we have been able to improve it and share it with you. 

You can download the slides from the talk here on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/asciamanna/ping-pong-pair-programming-phillyxp). The live videos have been replaced with links to YouTube videos.

Hopefully we piqued your interest in Bryan Helmkamp's fantastic  talk from Baruco2013, [Building a Culture of Quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsi1YTkXwxA). Bryan has a lot of great advice to help development teams improve, we recommend checking it out!
