### PhillyXP - Ping Pong Pair Programming
_February 1, 2018_

Thanks for attending (or otherwise being interested) in the PhillyXP talk about Ping Pong Pair Programming. We first gave this talk at the Heart of Agile Conference in 2017, and we're happy we have been able to improve it and share it with you. 

You can find the talk slides here on speakerdeck. The live videos have been replaced with links to YouTube videos.

Hopefully we piqued your interest in Bryan Helmkamp's fantastic  talk from Baruco2013, [Building a Culture of Quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsi1YTkXwxA). Bryan has a lot of great advice to help development teams improve, we recommend checking it out! 

If you are interested in seeing the code we produced for the interactive Ping Pong Pair Programming demo (and any updates since the talk) the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asciamanna/ping-pong-pair-programming-talk).

For more information about Ping Pong Pair Programming you can read my blog post about the topic [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-04-18-ping-pong-pair-programming %}).
