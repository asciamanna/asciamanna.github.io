title: Jazz 101
---

I've been asked recently where to start with jazz music. I have so many different recommendations that I decided to create this page to for anyone who is looking to get into jazz. For me jazz has been a very long and rewarding journey and I'd love to share what I've found with others.

### Start with Miles

One recommendation for starting with jazz is to listen to Miles Davis, find the  period you like best, and begin to investigate his sidemen. While I
had never heard of this, if you tracked my introduction to jazz I absolutely followed Miles' sidemen given the vast number of jazz giants Miles
played with over the years.

To investigate Miles' records and sidemen check out this wonderful, interactive site, [Scaled In Miles](https://fathom.info/miles/).

### The List
Here is a list of some of my favorite jazz albums. I love vocal jazz and fusion, but for *Jazz 101* I am sticking with instrumental jazz music released in the 1950s and 60s.
This is considered the "Golden age of Jazz" and contains some of the most popular bebop and hard bop albums ever created. I will follow up with some of my favorite vocal jazz
albums and fusion albums.

This list is in no particular order, except for Kind of Blue. That album has long been considered the best jazz album of all time. And it is the album to start with if you
are new to jazz. If you don't enjoy that album then jazz music is probably not for you.
