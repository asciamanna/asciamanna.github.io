### Music

Besides my passion for software development, XP, and coaching I am huge music fan and
music collector. Prior to pursuing a career in software development I was a musician.
I attended [Berklee College Of Music](http://www.berklee.edu).

In the late 90s early 2000s I was in a progressive metal band called Clockwork. We
released our debut album in 1999.

I am a music geek and love listening to jazz, fusion, progressive rock, progressive metal, metal, and new wave / post punk. 

#### Jazz

I often get asked about where to start with jazz music so I wrote this [Jazz 101](/jazz-101.html)
article. If you are interested you can check out my [jazz music collection](/jazz-collection.html).
